The data were featured in an oral presentation at the  (ADA) annual conference in  as part of the symposium, “Innovation and Progress in Stem Cell-Derived Islet-Cell Replacement Therapy,” from  (abstract 2025-A-1921) and published online by the .\\n\\nThe data are from 12 patients who received the full dose of zimislecel as a single infusion and were followed for at least one year, as of . Results from the study to date continue to demonstrate the transformative potential of zimislecel with consistent and durable patient benefit with longer follow-up. All12 participants:\\n\\n- Demonstrated engraftment with glucose-responsive endogenous C-peptide production, which was durable through one year of follow-up.\\n- Achieved the  targets of HbA1c <7% and time in range of >70%.\\n- Were free of SHEs from day 90 onwards.\\n- Had a reduction in exogenous insulin use (mean reduction in daily insulin dose: 92%).\\n - 10/12 (83%) no longer required exogenous insulin at Month 12.\\n- Achieved the Phase 1/2 primary endpoint of elimination of SHEs with HbA1c <7%.\\n\\nZimislecel continues to be generally well tolerated. Most adverse events (AEs) were mild or moderate, and there were no serious AEs related to zimislecel treatment. As previously reported, two patient deaths occurred, both unrelated to treatment with zimislecel. The safety profile is generally consistent with the immunosuppressive regimen used in the study, the infusion procedure, and complications from long-standing diabetes.\\n\\n“These data on the first fully differentiated, stem cell-derived, off-the-shelf islet cell therapy continue to be unprecedented. The magnitude, consistency and durability of the results from all 12 patients with more than one year of follow-up reinforce the transformative potential of zimislecel for people living with T1D complicated by severe hypoglycemia,” said , M.D., Executive Vice President,  and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Officer at . “We are excited to complete enrollment and dosing in the Phase 1/2/3 Program and look forward to potential regulatory submissions next year.”\\n\\n“It’s remarkable to see 12 out of 12 patients with baseline HbA1c above 7% and multiple severe hypoglycemic events reach consensus targets for glycemic control by both HbA1c and time in range as well as elimination of severe hypoglycemic events,” said , M.D., M.S., Medical Director, Pancreatic Islet Cell Transplant Program, Willard and  in Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and Presenting Author and Steering Committee Co-Chair for the zimislecel clinical program, and author on the  paper. “As I think about my patients and the unmet need in the type 1 diabetes community, the results we’ve seen so far for restoring endogenous insulin secretion with a stem cell-derived islet therapy bring me hope and confidence for a transformative treatment option for individuals with type 1 diabetes in the not-so-distant future.”\\n\\n**About Type 1 Diabetes**\\n\\nT1D results from the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in pancreatic islets. Insulin deficiency results in hyperglycemia and can lead to acute life-threatening complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis.\\n\\nPeople with T1D are reliant on lifelong treatment with exogenous insulin that requires careful monitoring of blood glucose levels. Even with the availability of advanced exogenous insulin delivery and glucose monitoring systems, people with T1D can have periods of very low and very high blood sugar levels. Exogenous insulin has a narrow therapeutic range and carries an inherent risk of causing low blood sugar levels or hypoglycemic events, which can potentially result in arrhythmias, seizures, coma and even death. Due to the limitations and complexities of exogenous insulin treatment, it can be difficult for people with T1D to achieve and maintain good glucose control. Exposure to prolonged periods of high blood glucose levels, or hyperglycemia, can lead to long-term complications such as nerve damage, kidney disease/failure, eye disease (including vision loss), cardiovascular disease, stroke and even death.\\n\\nHbA1c is a measure of average blood glucose over the most recent ~2-3 months, and the consensus guidance is to maintain an HbA1c of <7% to reduce the risk of long-term complications; only ~1 in 4 people with T1D globally meet this clinical target. Current standards of care do not address the underlying cause of the disease and leave people with T1D susceptible to both hypo- and hyperglycemia and their associated morbidity and mortality. There is no cure for T1D.\\n\\n**About Zimislecel**\\n\\nZimislecel (VX-880) is an investigational allogeneic stem cell-derived, fully differentiated, insulin-producing islet cell therapy manufactured using proprietary technology. Zimislecel is being evaluated for patients who have T1D with impaired hypoglycemic awareness and severe hypoglycemia. Zimislecel has the potential to restore the body’s ability to regulate glucose levels by restoring pancreatic islet cell function, including glucose-responsive insulin production. Zimislecel is delivered by an infusion into the hepatic portal vein and requires chronic immunosuppressive therapy to protect the islet cells from immune rejection. The zimislecel trial has expanded to additional sites that are currently active and enrolling in the ,  and .\\n\\nZimislecel has been granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) and Fast Track designations from the , Priority Medicines (PRIME) designation from the  (EMA), and has secured an Innovation Passport under the  and Access Pathway (ILAP) from the  Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Key findings indicate that zimislecel showed promising efficacy and safety in a small cohort, but limitations include the early-phase trial stage and small sample size.\n\n---\n\n**Introduction**  \nThe user's request focused on emerging experimental treatments and clinical trials for diabetes with promising results. The tool output synthesized results from a neural search, returning two sources: a 2025 press release from Vertex Pharmaceuticals on zimislecel for T1D, and a 2021 homepage from the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, which was not relevant to the query.\n\n---\n\n**Main Findings**\n\n1. **Vertex Zimislecel Clinical Trial (FORWARD-101, 2025)**\n   - **Therapy Description**: Zimislecel (VX-880) is an investigational, allogeneic stem cell-derived, fully differentiated islet cell therapy designed to restore insulin production in T1D patients with impaired hypoglycemic awareness and severe hypoglycemia ([Vertex, 2025](https://investors.vrtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vertex-presents-positive-data-zimislecel-type-1-diabetes)).\n   - **Study Population**: 12 patients with T1D, each with at least one year of follow-up after a single full-dose infusion.\n   - **Efficacy Outcomes**:\n     - All 12 achieved target HbA1c <7% and >70% time-in-range (70-180 mg/dL).\n     - 10 of 12 (83%) were insulin-free at 12 months.\n     - All were free of severe hypoglycemic events from day 90 onward.\n     - Mean reduction in daily insulin dose: 92%.\n   - **Safety Outcomes**:\n     - Zimislecel was generally well tolerated.\n     - Most adverse events were mild or moderate; no serious events attributed to zimislecel.\n     - Two patient deaths occurred, both unrelated to treatment.\n   - **Regulatory Status**: Zimislecel has received RMAT, Fast Track, PRIME, and Innovation Passport designations. It is not yet approved.\n\n2. **Harvard Stem Cell Institute Source**\n   - The provided URL led to the institute's homepage and contained no relevant information on experimental diabetes treatments or trials.\n\n---\n\n**Critical Analysis of Evidence Quality**\n\n- **Vertex Source**: The information is from a corporate press release, summarizing interim results from a Phase 1/2 trial presented at a major scientific conference (ADA 2025). While promising, the evidence is preliminary, based on a small cohort (n=12) and lacking peer-reviewed publication or long-term follow-up data. The source is authoritative regarding the trial's existence and basic results but carries potential bias as a company communication.\n- **Harvard Source**: Irrelevant; does not provide evidence or data.\n\n---\n\n**Synthesis of Key Insights and Patterns**\n\n- Zimislecel represents a novel approach to T1D, aiming to address the root cause—loss of islet cells—rather than just managing symptoms.\n- The results suggest potential for durable glycemic control and insulin independence in a subset of high-risk T1D patients.\n- Safety profile appears acceptable, with no zimislecel-attributed serious adverse events, but immunosuppression remains a requirement.\n- The trial is ongoing, and regulatory submissions are anticipated, reflecting momentum in the field of stem cell-derived therapies for diabetes.\n\n---\n\n**Limitations and Gaps**\n\n- **Sample Size**: Only 12 patients with one year of follow-up; results may not generalize.\n- **Trial Phase**: Early-phase (Phase 1/2), with further data needed from larger, longer-term studies.\n- **Source Type**: Data from a press release, not a peer-reviewed journal.\n- **Immunosuppression**: Chronic immunosuppression is required, which may limit applicability.\n- **No Data on Type 2 Diabetes or Other Modalities**: The search did not return information on other experimental treatments or on type 2 diabetes.\n\n---\n\n**Evidence-based Conclusions**\n\n- Zimislecel shows strong preliminary efficacy and safety as an experimental therapy for T1D with impaired hypoglycemic awareness, with the potential to reduce or eliminate insulin dependence for some patients ([Vertex, 2025](https://investors.vrtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vertex-presents-positive-data-zimislecel-type-1-diabetes)).\n- The evidence is promising but early-stage; larger, controlled studies and peer-reviewed publications will be required to confirm these findings and support regulatory approval.\n\n---\n\n**Future Research Directions**\n\n- Completion of ongoing Phase 1/2/3 studies to assess efficacy and safety in a larger, more diverse population.\n- Long-term follow-up to evaluate durability of response and late adverse events.\n- Research to minimize or eliminate the need for immunosuppression.\n- Comparative studies with other emerging therapies for T1D and exploration of applicability to broader diabetes populations.\n\n---\n\n**Errors and Issues Highlighted**\n\n- The second returned source (Harvard Stem Cell Institute homepage) was not relevant and did not address the user query.\n- The primary finding is based on a company press release, which, while timely and detailed, is not a substitute for peer-reviewed evidence.\n\n---\n\n**References**  \n- Vertex Pharmaceuticals.

Lantidra is approved for the treatment of adults with type 1 diabetes who are unable to approach target glycated hemoglobin (average blood glucose levels) because of current repeated episodes of severe hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) despite intensive diabetes management and education.\\n\\n**“Severe hypoglycemia is a dangerous condition that can lead to injuries resulting from loss of consciousness or seizures,” said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. “Today’s approval, the first-ever cell therapy to treat patients with type 1 diabetes, provides individuals living with type 1 diabetes and recurrent severe hypoglycemia an additional treatment option to help achieve target blood glucose levels.”**\\n\\nType 1 diabetes is a chronic autoimmune disease that requires lifelong care including requiring insulin, either through multiple daily injections or continuous infusion using a pump, every day to live. People with type 1 diabetes also perform blood glucose checks several times a day to guide the management of their diabetes.\\n\\nSome people with type 1 diabetes have trouble managing the amount of insulin needed every day to prevent hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) without causing hypoglycemia. They may also develop hypoglycemia unawareness, where they are unable to detect their blood glucose is dropping and may not have a chance to treat themselves to prevent their blood glucose from further dropping. This makes it difficult to dose insulin. Lantidra provides a potential treatment option for these patients.\\n\\nThe primary mechanism of action of Lantidra is believed to be the secretion of insulin by the infused allogeneic islet beta cells. In some patients with type 1 diabetes, these infused cells can produce enough insulin, so the patient no longer needs to take insulin (by injections or pump) to control their blood sugar levels. Lantidra is administered as a single infusion into the hepatic (liver) portal vein. An additional infusion of Lantidra may be performed depending on the patient’s response to the initial dose.\\n\\nThe safety and effectiveness of Lantidra was evaluated in two non-randomized, single-arm studies in which a total of 30 participants with type 1 diabetes and hypoglycemic unawareness received at least one infusion and a maximum of three infusions. Overall, 21 participants did not need to take insulin for a year or more, with 11 participants not needing insulin for one to five years and 10 participants not needing insulin for more than five years. Five participants did not achieve any days of insulin independence.\\n\\nAdverse reactions associated with Lantidra varied with each participant depending on the number of infusions they received and the length of time they were followed and may not reflect the rates observed in practice The most common adverse reactions included nausea, fatigue, anemia, diarrhea and abdominal pain. A majority of participants experienced at least one serious adverse reaction related to the procedure for infusing Lantidra into the hepatic portal vein and the use of immunosuppressive medications needed to maintain the islet cell viability.  Some serious adverse reactions required discontinuation of immunosuppressive medications, which resulted in the loss of islet cell function and insulin independence.

While insulin injections help replace the lost beta cell and pancreatic function in persons with diabetes, Tzield aims to slow the autoimmune destruction of the beta cells that occurs in Type 1 diabetes. This lets the body continue to produce its own insulin, decreasing the need for insulin injections. Tzield is only approved in early forms of diabetes when more beta cells are still present and ongoing normal insulin is still produced.\\n\\n“Our team for years has been striving to bring every new treatment for kids with diabetes into the clinic as quickly as possible — new insulins, new pumps, continuous glucose monitors, nasal and pre-mixed glucagon formulations, and partial-closed loop artificial pancreas systems,” said Sparling. “On top of that, we’ve been maintaining an active research arm looking for causes and the best treatments of both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes in kids.”\\n\\nThat research, which takes place at [OU Health Harold Hamm Diabetes Center at The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences](https://www.ouhealth.com/harold-hamm-diabetes-center), brings OU Health patients access to the latest treatments and research breakthroughs and to clinical trials networks like [TrialNet](https://www.trialnet.org/). TrialNet is an international network of academic institutions, endocrinologists, physicians, scientists and healthcare teams leading Type 1 diabetes research and offering risk screening and clinical studies. TrialNet has many arms, several of which OU Health are a part of.\\n\\nTeplizumab was first characterized and studied within TrialNet and once was found to be beneficial, the treatment was expanded into a full clinical trial. Once the Stage 3 trials demonstrated a benefit to persons with Type 1 diabetes, it was approved by the FDA, enabling treatments to begin.\\n\\nType 1 diabetes occurs when the immune system destroys the cells that make insulin, so people with the disease require insulin shots or an insulin pump to survive. Usually diagnosed in children and young adults, Type 1 diabetes can appear at any age, and most patients have no family history of the disease. Identification and treatment of high-risk children can prevent serious complications like diabetic ketoacidosis from occurring, as well as slow the need for treatment.\\n\\nTzield is prescribed for adults and children 8 years and older who are considered high-risk for a Type 1 diabetes diagnosis. Risks include testing positive for two or more Type 1 diabetes-related autoantibodies, having abnormal blood sugar levels and no diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes.\\n\\nThe drug blocks a step in the immune system that’s known to lead to diabetes progression and has shown to significantly delay the onset of clinical diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes by two to five years.\\n\\nSparling said being part of an academic ecosystem where research informs new treatments means patients have access to breakthrough medications like Tzield as well as the latest and most advanced understanding of complex disease processes like diabetes.\\n\\n_If you or a loved one is at high risk for Type 1 diabetes, call your [primary care doctor.](https://www.ouhealth.com/health-services/primary-care-for-adults/) Learn more about Tzield at [Harold Hamm Diabetes Center](https://www.ouhealth.com/harold-hamm-diabetes-center/diabetes-services/diabetes-care-for-children/) or call (405) 271-6764 to make an appointment._\\n\\n- [![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==)](https://www.ouhealth.com/blog/2025/may/laureate-announced-for-hamm-international-prize-2/)\\n- [![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==)](https://www.ouhealth.com/blog/2025/june/ou-health-onsite-teams-cared-for-900-parade-atte/)\\n- [![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==)](https://www.ouhealth.com/blog/2023/january/earn-money-using-your-mobile-device-to-quit-smok/)\\n\\n- [![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==)**Laureate Announced for Hamm ...** Featured, News\\\\\\nThe prestigious Harold Hamm International Prize for Biomedical Research in Diabetes, an honor bestowed by OU Health Harold Hamm Diabetes Center at the ...\\\\\\nContinue Reading](https://www.ouhealth.com/blog/2025/may/laureate-announced-for-hamm-international-prize-2/)\\n\\n![OU Health](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==)\\n\\n- ![NCI Cancer Center](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==)\",\n      \"summary\": \"{\\\"answer\\\":\\\"A new treatment for Type 1 diabetes, Tzield (Teplizumab), is now available at OU Health.

Five participants did not achieve insulin independence.\n   - **Risks:** Common adverse reactions include nausea, fatigue, anemia, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Serious risks are associated with the infusion procedure and required immunosuppression, sometimes resulting in loss of islet function.\n   - **Patient Selection:** Reserved for those with severe hypoglycemia unawareness and unmanageable glycemic control with conventional therapy.\n\n2. **Tzield (Teplizumab)**\n   - **FDA Approval:** Recent (exact date not specified in output, but external sources confirm November 2022).\n   - **Indication:** Adults and children (8+) at high risk for developing type 1 diabetes, especially those with two or more autoantibodies and abnormal blood sugar but not yet diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.\n   - **Mechanism:** Immune modulation to slow the autoimmune destruction of beta cells, thereby delaying progression to clinical (Stage 3) type 1 diabetes.\n   - **Clinical Evidence:** Shown to significantly delay the onset of clinical type 1 diabetes by 2–5 years in high-risk individuals.\n   - **Availability:** Now offered at OU Health, including pediatric patients.\n   - **Significance:** First disease-modifying therapy for type 1 diabetes since insulin, targeting the underlying autoimmune process rather than just replacing insulin.\n\n**Critical Issues & Errors:**\n- **No technical errors** in the tool output.\n- **Limitations:** The summary for Tzield does not specify the FDA approval date or detailed adverse event profile. The Lantidra study sample size is small (n=30), and studies were non-randomized and single-arm, limiting generalizability and strength of evidence.\n\n**Relevance to User Request:**\n- The output provides up-to-date information on the two most significant recent FDA-approved therapies for type 1 diabetes: Lantidra (for severe, refractory cases) and Tzield (for delaying onset in high-risk individuals).\n- Both therapies represent major advances: Lantidra is the first cell-based therapy to restore insulin production, and Tzield is the first immunotherapy to delay disease onset.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Lantidra** offers a new, cell-based treatment option for adults with severe, unmanageable type 1 diabetes, with the potential for insulin independence but significant risks and limited to a select patient group.\n- **Tzield** is a groundbreaking immunotherapy now available for high-risk adults and children, capable of delaying the progression to full-blown type 1 diabetes by several years.\n- Both approvals mark the most significant advances in type 1 diabetes treatment since the introduction of insulin, each targeting different stages and aspects of the disease.\n\n**Actionable Insight:**  \nProviders should consider Lantidra for adults with type 1 diabetes and recurrent severe hypoglycemia unresponsive to standard care, and Tzield for delaying type 1 diabetes in high-risk individuals, particularly children and those with multiple autoantibodies.\n\n**Future Directions:**  \n- Further randomized controlled trials are needed for Lantidra to establish long-term efficacy and safety.\n- Broader real-world data collection for Tzield will clarify its long-term impact and optimal patient selection.

No critical errors were detected in the tool output; however, the second result references the forthcoming 2025 guidelines without substantive detail.\n\n---\n\n**Introduction: Context and Scope**  \nThe user requested an analysis of current ADA and international diabetes guidelines and standards of care for diabetes treatment (2024). The tool output includes two main sources:  \n1. The ADA’s official press release on the 2024 Standards of Care in Diabetes.  \n2. A PubMed listing for the 2025 ADA Standards (with limited content), confirming the annual update process and referencing related literature.\n\n---\n\n**Main Findings Organized by Themes**\n\n**1. Key Updates in ADA Standards of Care 2024**  \n*Source: ADA Press Release, Dec 2023 ([link](https://diabetes.org/newsroom/press-releases/american-diabetes-association-releases-standards-care-diabetes-2024))*\n\n- **Obesity Management**:  \n  - New recommendations to reduce therapeutic inertia and personalize care.  \n  - Incorporation of additional obesity metrics (waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, waist-to-height ratio) beyond BMI.\n  - Expanded guidance on the use of new obesity medications (GLP-1 agonists, dual GIP receptor agonists).\n\n- **Screening Enhancements**:  \n  - New screening protocols for heart failure and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in diabetes patients.\n  - Emphasis on screening for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and bone health (fracture risk).\n\n- **Type 1 Diabetes Prevention**:  \n  - Guidance on screening and use of teplizumab to delay onset.\n\n- **Technology and Digital Health**:  \n  - Promotes provider mastery of diabetes technology, including AI-based retinal screening, telehealth, continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), and automated insulin delivery (AID) systems.\n\n- **Immunization and Psychosocial Care**:  \n  - Updated immunization guidance (including RSV vaccines for adults 60+ with diabetes).\n  - Emphasis on cultural sensitivity, psychosocial screening, and person-centered care.\n\n- **COVID-19**:  \n  - New information on possible association between COVID-19 and new-onset type 1 diabetes.\n\n- **Process and Endorsements**:  \n  - The Standards are updated annually by a multidisciplinary committee and endorsed by relevant specialty societies.\n\n**2. ADA Standards of Care Process and General Goals**  \n*Source: PubMed (2025 draft abstract)*\n\n- The ADA Standards of Care provide comprehensive, evidence-based recommendations for all aspects of diabetes care, including diagnosis, treatment, and quality monitoring.\n- The update process is annual, led by the ADA Professional Practice Committee, with interim updates as new evidence arises.\n- The guidelines are widely cited and form the basis for clinical care and quality assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Critical Analysis of Evidence Quality**\n\n- **Authoritativeness**: The ADA is the leading U.S. authority on diabetes care. The guidelines are developed by an expert, multidisciplinary committee and endorsed by other major societies.\n- **Recency**: The 2024 guidelines represent the most current, peer-reviewed consensus as of December 2023.\n- **Transparency**: The press release details the update process, committee composition, and areas of expert input.\n- **Breadth**: The guidelines cover all major domains of diabetes care, including emerging areas (technology, psychosocial care, COVID-19).\n- **Limitations**:  \n  - The output does not include non-ADA international guidelines (e.g., IDF, EASD, NICE), so global harmonization is not addressed.\n  - Detailed, section-by-section recommendations are not provided in the output; only highlights are summarized.\n  - The second source (2025 abstract) is a placeholder with minimal substantive content.\n\n---\n\n**Synthesis of Key Insights and Patterns**\n\n- The ADA’s 2024 Standards of Care reflect an increasing emphasis on personalized, holistic, and technology-enabled diabetes management.\n- There is a clear trend toward integrating new medications, digital tools, and screening protocols to address comorbidities and complications.\n- Population-specific considerations (e.g., cultural sensitivity, disability, psychosocial distress) are receiving greater attention.\n- The guidelines remain dynamic, with mechanisms for rapid updates as new evidence emerges.\n\n---\n\n**Limitations and Gaps Identified**\n\n- **International Guidelines**: The output is limited to ADA sources; perspectives or recommendations from international bodies (e.g., International Diabetes Federation, European Association for the Study of Diabetes) are not included.\n- **Granularity**: While major updates are summarized, detailed clinical algorithms and targets (e.g., glycemic thresholds, medication selection pathways) are not presented.\n- **2025 Guidelines**: The mention of 2025 guidelines is anticipatory, with no substantive new content.\n\n---\n\n**Evidence-Based Conclusions**\n\n- The ADA 2024 Standards of Care represent the current gold standard for diabetes management in the U.S., with significant updates in obesity treatment, screening, technology, and holistic care.\n- These guidelines are developed through a rigorous, multidisciplinary, and annually updated process, ensuring alignment with the latest evidence.\n- The 2024 edition underscores the importance of individualized, inclusive, and technologically advanced approaches to diabetes care.\n\n---\n\n**Future Research Directions**\n\n- Comparative analysis of ADA guidelines with those from other international organizations to identify areas of alignment and divergence.\n- Evaluation of the clinical impact of new screening and obesity management recommendations.\n- Ongoing assessment of the integration of digital health tools and AI in diabetes care delivery.\n- Investigation into the long-term effects of COVID-19 on diabetes incidence and management strategies.\n\n---\n\n**Highlighted Issues or Errors**\n\n- No critical errors detected in the tool output.\n- The 2025 guideline reference is forward-looking and not relevant for current clinical practice.\n- Absence of non-ADA international guideline content limits the global scope.\n\n---\n\n**References**  \n- American Diabetes Association.

Eligible trials compared any of the specified doses of tirzepatide and semaglutide against each other, placebo or other glucose-lowering drugs. Primary outcomes were changes in HbA1c and body weight from baseline. Secondary outcomes were achievement of HbA1c target of ≤48 mmol/mol (≤6.5%) or <53 mmol/mol (<7.0%), body weight loss of at least 10%, and safety outcomes including gastrointestinal adverse events and severe hypoglycaemia. We used version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (ROB 2) to assess the risk of bias, conducted frequentist random-effects network meta-analyses and evaluated confidence in effect estimates utilising the Confidence In Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA) framework.\\n\\n**Results:** A total of 28 trials with 23,622 participants (44.2% female) were included. Compared with placebo, tirzepatide 15 mg was the most efficacious treatment in reducing HbA1c (mean difference -21.61 mmol/mol \\\\[-1.96%\\\\]) followed by tirzepatide 10 mg (-20.19 mmol/mol \\\\[-1.84%\\\\]), semaglutide 2.0 mg (-17.74 mmol/mol \\\\[-1.59%\\\\]), tirzepatide 5 mg (-17.60 mmol/mol \\\\[-1.60%\\\\]), semaglutide 1.0 mg (-15.25 mmol/mol \\\\[-1.39%\\\\]) and semaglutide 0.5 mg (-12.00 mmol/mol \\\\[-1.09%\\\\]). In between-drug comparisons, all tirzepatide doses were comparable with semaglutide 2.0 mg and superior to semaglutide 1.0 mg and 0.5 mg. Compared with placebo, tirzepatide was more efficacious than semaglutide for reducing body weight, with reductions ranging from 9.57 kg (tirzepatide 15 mg) to 5.27 kg (tirzepatide 5 mg). Semaglutide had a less pronounced effect, with reductions ranging from 4.97 kg (semaglutide 2.0 mg) to 2.52 kg (semaglutide 0.5 mg). In between-drug comparisons, tirzepatide 15 mg, 10 mg and 5 mg demonstrated greater efficacy than semaglutide 2.0 mg, 1.0 mg and 0.5 mg, respectively. Both drugs increased incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events compared with placebo, while neither tirzepatide nor semaglutide increased the risk of serious adverse events or severe hypoglycaemia.\\n\\n**Conclusions/interpretation:** Our data show that s.c. tirzepatide had a more pronounced effect on HbA1c and weight reduction compared with s.c. semaglutide in people with type 2 diabetes. Both drugs, particularly higher doses of tirzepatide, increased gastrointestinal adverse events.\\n\\n**Registration:** PROSPERO registration no.

We aimed\\n to assess the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide versus titrated insulin degludec\\n in people with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by metformin with or without\\n SGLT2 inhibitors. \\n Methods \\n In this open-label, parallel-group, multicentre (122 sites), multinational (13 countries),\\n phase 3 study, eligible participants (aged ≥18 years) had a baseline glycated haemoglobin\\n (HbA 1c) of 7·0–10·5%, body-mass index of at least 25 kg/m 2, stable weight, and were insulin-naive and treated with metformin alone or in combination\\n with an SGLT2 inhibitor for at least 3 months before screening. Participants were\\n randomly assigned (1:1:1:1), using an interactive web-response system, to once-weekly\\n subcutaneous injection of tirzepatide (5, 10, or 15 mg) or once-daily subcutaneous\\n injection of titrated insulin degludec, and were stratified by country, HbA 1c, and concomitant use of oral antihyperglycaemic medications. Tirzepatide was initially\\n given at 2·5 mg and the dose was escalated by 2·5 mg every 4 weeks until the assigned\\n dose was reached. Insulin degludec was initially given at 10 U per day and was titrated\\n once weekly to a fasting self-monitored blood glucose of less than 5·0 mmol/L (&lt;90\\n mg/dL), following a treat-to-target algorithm, for 52 weeks. The primary efficacy\\n endpoint was non-inferiority of tirzepatide 10 mg or 15 mg, or both, versus insulin\\n degludec in mean change from baseline in HbA 1c at week 52. Key secondary efficacy endpoints were non-inferiority of tirzepatide\\n 5 mg versus insulin degludec in mean change from baseline in HbA 1c at week 52, superiority of all doses of tirzepatide versus insulin degludec in mean\\n change from baseline in HbA 1c and bodyweight, and the proportion of participants achieving HbA 1c of less than 7·0% (&lt;53 mmol/mol) at week 52. We used a boundary of 0·3% to establish\\n non-inferiority in HbA 1c difference between treatments. Efficacy and safety analyses were assessed in the\\n modified intention-to-treat population (all participants who received at least one\\n dose of study drug). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03882970, and is complete. \\n Findings \\n Between April 1 and Nov 15, 2019, we assessed 1947 participants for eligibility, 1444\\n of whom were randomly assigned to treatment. The modified intention-to-treat population\\n was 1437 participants from the tirzepatide 5 mg (n=358), tirzepatide 10 mg (n=360),\\n tirzepatide 15 mg (n=359), and insulin degludec (n=360) groups. From a mean baseline\\n HbA 1c of 8·17% (SD 0·91), the reductions in HbA 1c at week 52 were 1·93% (SE 0·05) for tirzepatide 5 mg, 2·20% (0·05) for tirzepatide\\n 10 mg, and 2·37% (0·05) for tirzepatide 15 mg, and 1·34% (0·05) for insulin degludec.\\n The non-inferiority margin of 0·3% was met. The estimated treatment difference (ETD)\\n versus insulin degludec ranged from –0·59% to –1·04% for tirzepatide (p&lt;0·0001 for\\n all tirzepatide doses). The proportion of participants achieving a HbA 1c of less than 7·0% (&lt;53 mmol/mol) at week 52 was greater (p&lt;0·0001) in all three tirzepatide\\n groups (82%–93%) versus insulin degludec (61%). At week 52, from a baseline of 94·3\\n kg (SD 20·1), all three tirzepatide doses decreased bodyweight (–7·5 kg to –12·9 kg),\\n whereas insulin degludec increased bodyweight by 2·3 kg. The ETD versus insulin degludec\\n ranged from –9·8 kg to –15·2 kg for tirzepatide (p&lt;0·0001 for all tirzepatide doses).\\n The most common adverse events in tirzepatide-treated participants were mild to moderate\\n gastrointestinal events that decreased over time. A higher incidence of nausea (12–24%),\\n diarrhoea (15–17%), decreased appetite (6–12%), and vomiting (6–10%) was reported\\n in participants treated with tirzepatide than in those treated with insulin degludec\\n (2%, 4%, 1%, and 1%, respectively). Hypoglycaemia (&lt;54 mg/dL or severe) was reported\\n in five (1%), four (1%), and eight (2%) participants on tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15\\n mg, respectively, versus 26 (7%) on insulin degludec. Treatment discontinuation due\\n to an adverse event was more common in the tirzepatide groups than in the insulin\\n degludec group. Five participants died during the study; none of the deaths were considered\\n by the investigators to be related to the study treatment. \\n Interpretation \\n In patients with type 2 diabetes, tirzepatide (5, 10, and 15 mg) was superior to titrated\\n insulin degludec, with greater reductions in HbA 1c and bodyweight at week 52 and a lower risk of hypoglycaemia. Tirzepatide showed a\\n similar safety profile to that of GLP-1 receptor agonists. \\n Funding \\n Eli Lilly and Company. \\n \\n To read this article in full you will need to make a payment References 1.

GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), which are released from the intestines after meals, are responsible for augmenting insulin secretion (ie, the incretin effect). Because the insulinotropic effect of GIP is markedly attenuated in type 2 diabetes, therapeutic development to date has focused on GLP-1, which also lowers blood glucose by suppressing glucagon and energy intake, and slowing gastric emptying. 1 Use of GLP-1 receptor agonists for the management of type 2 diabetes is increasing rapidly, and is associated with weight loss, negligible risk of hypoglycaemia, and potential cardiovascular protection. \\n Full-Text\\n \\n PDF\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n ||||I|||| Skip to Main Content\\n\\n Login to your account\\n\\n Email/Username\\n Password\\n Show\\n Forgot password?\\n Remember me\\n Don’t have an account?\\n Create a Free Account\\n\\n If you don't remember your password, you can reset it by entering your email address and clicking the Reset Password button.

once-daily insulin degludec as add-on to metformin with or without SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes (SURPASS-3): a randomised, open-label, parallel-group, phase 3 trial\\n Previous Article Department of Error\\n Next Article Risk of acute myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke following COVID-19 in Sweden: a self-controlled case series and matched cohort study\\n\\n Summary\\n\\n Background\\n\\n Tirzepatide is a novel dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and GLP-1 receptor agonist under development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide versus titrated insulin degludec in people with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by metformin with or without SGLT2 inhibitors.\\n\\n Methods\\n\\n In this open-label, parallel-group, multicentre (122 sites), multinational (13 countries), phase 3 study, eligible participants (aged ≥18 years) had a baseline glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) of 7·0–10·5%, body-mass index of at least 25 kg/m2, stable weight, and were insulin-naive and treated with metformin alone or in combination with an SGLT2 inhibitor for at least 3 months before screening. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1), using an interactive web-response system, to once-weekly subcutaneous injection of tirzepatide (5, 10, or 15 mg) or once-daily subcutaneous injection of titrated insulin degludec, and were stratified by country, HbA1c, and concomitant use of oral antihyperglycaemic medications. Tirzepatide was initially given at 2·5 mg and the dose was escalated by 2·5 mg every 4 weeks until the assigned dose was reached. Insulin degludec was initially given at 10 U per day and was titrated once weekly to a fasting self-monitored blood glucose of less than 5·0 mmol/L (<90 mg/dL), following a treat-to-target algorithm, for 52 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was non-inferiority of tirzepatide 10 mg or 15 mg, or both, versus insulin degludec in mean change from baseline in HbA1c at week 52. Key secondary efficacy endpoints were non-inferiority of tirzepatide 5 mg versus insulin degludec in mean change from baseline in HbA1c at week 52, superiority of all doses of tirzepatide versus insulin degludec in mean change from baseline in HbA1c and bodyweight, and the proportion of participants achieving HbA1c of less than 7·0% (<53 mmol/mol) at week 52. We used a boundary of 0·3% to establish non-inferiority in HbA1c difference between treatments. Efficacy and safety analyses were assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population (all participants who received at least one dose of study drug). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03882970, and is complete.\\n\\n Findings\\n\\n Between April 1 and Nov 15, 2019, we assessed 1947 participants for eligibility, 1444 of whom were randomly assigned to treatment. The modified intention-to-treat population was 1437 participants from the tirzepatide 5 mg (n=358), tirzepatide 10 mg (n=360), tirzepatide 15 mg (n=359), and insulin degludec (n=360) groups. From a mean baseline HbA1c of 8·17% (SD 0·91), the reductions in HbA1c at week 52 were 1·93% (SE 0·05) for tirzepatide 5 mg, 2·20% (0·05) for tirzepatide 10 mg, and 2·37% (0·05) for tirzepatide 15 mg, and 1·34% (0·05) for insulin degludec. The non-inferiority margin of 0·3% was met. The estimated treatment difference (ETD) versus insulin degludec ranged from –0·59% to –1·04% for tirzepatide (p<0·0001 for all tirzepatide doses). The proportion of participants achieving a HbA1c of less than 7·0% (<53 mmol/mol) at week 52 was greater (p<0·0001) in all three tirzepatide groups (82%–93%) versus insulin degludec (61%). At week 52, from a baseline of 94·3 kg (SD 20·1), all three tirzepatide doses decreased bodyweight (–7·5 kg to –12·9 kg), whereas insulin degludec increased bodyweight by 2·3 kg. The ETD versus insulin degludec ranged from –9·8 kg to –15·2 kg for tirzepatide (p<0·0001 for all tirzepatide doses). The most common adverse events in tirzepatide-treated participants were mild to moderate gastrointestinal events that decreased over time. A higher incidence of nausea (12–24%), diarrhoea (15–17%), decreased appetite (6–12%), and vomiting (6–10%) was reported in participants treated with tirzepatide than in those treated with insulin degludec (2%, 4%, 1%, and 1%, respectively). Hypoglycaemia (<54 mg/dL or severe) was reported in five (1%), four (1%), and eight (2%) participants on tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg, respectively, versus 26 (7%) on insulin degludec. Treatment discontinuation due to an adverse event was more common in the tirzepatide groups than in the insulin degludec group. Five participants died during the study; none of the deaths were considered by the investigators to be related to the study treatment.\\n\\n Interpretation\\n\\n In patients with type 2 diabetes, tirzepatide (5, 10, and 15 mg) was superior to titrated insulin degludec, with greater reductions in HbA1c and bodyweight at week 52 and a lower risk of hypoglycaemia. Tirzepatide showed a similar safety profile to that of GLP-1 receptor agonists.\\n\\n Funding\\n\\n Eli Lilly and Company.\\n To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\\n\\n Purchase one-time access:\\n\\n Academic & Personal: 24 hour online accessCorporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\\n One-time access price info\\n * For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\\n * For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\\n Or purchase The Lancet Choice\\n Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\\n\\n Subscribe:\\n\\n Subscribe to The Lancet\\n Already a print subscriber?

Both tirzepatide and semaglutide are associated with increased gastrointestinal side effects, but do not increase the risk of severe hypoglycemia or serious adverse events.\n\n---\n\n**Introduction**  \nThis synthesis evaluates the comparative efficacy and safety of newer pharmacological treatments for type 2 diabetes, focusing on tirzepatide versus semaglutide and insulin degludec, based on recent systematic reviews, network meta-analyses, and large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 2021 and 2024. The scope includes glycemic control (HbA1c reduction), weight change, and adverse event profiles.\n\n---\n\n**Main Findings**  \n\n**1. Comparative Efficacy: Tirzepatide vs. Semaglutide**  \n- A 2024 systematic review and network meta-analysis (Karagiannis et al., PubMed 38613667) of 28 RCTs (n=23,622) found that:\n  - **HbA1c Reduction**: Tirzepatide 15 mg had the largest reduction (-1.96%), followed by tirzepatide 10 mg (-1.84%), semaglutide 2.0 mg (-1.59%), tirzepatide 5 mg (-1.60%), semaglutide 1.0 mg (-1.39%), and semaglutide 0.5 mg (-1.09%) versus placebo.\n  - **Weight Loss**: Tirzepatide 15 mg led to a mean weight reduction of 9.57 kg, outperforming semaglutide 2.0 mg (4.97 kg) and lower doses of both drugs.\n  - **Between-Drug Comparison**: All doses of tirzepatide were at least as effective as semaglutide 2.0 mg and superior to semaglutide 1.0 mg and 0.5 mg for both HbA1c and weight reduction.\n  - **Safety**: Both drugs increased gastrointestinal adverse events (e.g., nausea, diarrhea) compared to placebo, but neither increased severe hypoglycemia or serious adverse events.\n\n**2. Comparative Efficacy: Tirzepatide vs. Insulin Degludec**  \n- The SURPASS-3 phase 3 trial (Ludvik et al., Lancet 2021/2023) compared tirzepatide (5, 10, 15 mg weekly) with titrated insulin degludec in patients inadequately controlled on metformin (± SGLT2 inhibitors):\n  - **HbA1c Reduction at 52 Weeks**: Tirzepatide 5 mg (-1.93%), 10 mg (-2.20%), 15 mg (-2.37%) vs. insulin degludec (-1.34%). All tirzepatide doses were statistically superior (ETD: -0.59% to -1.04%, p<0.0001).\n  - **Achievement of HbA1c <7.0%**: 82–93% (tirzepatide) vs. 61% (insulin degludec).\n  - **Weight Change**: Tirzepatide resulted in weight loss (-7.5 to -12.9 kg), whereas insulin degludec caused weight gain (+2.3 kg).\n  - **Adverse Events**: Gastrointestinal events were more common with tirzepatide, but hypoglycemia was less frequent compared to insulin degludec.\n\n---\n\n**Critical Analysis of Evidence Quality**  \n- Both primary sources are recent, high-quality, and peer-reviewed: a 2024 network meta-analysis (systematic review of RCTs) and a 2021/2023 phase 3 multinational RCT.\n- Risk of bias was systematically assessed (ROB 2 tool, CINeMA framework), and both studies included large, diverse populations.\n- The consistency of findings across different trials and populations strengthens the reliability of the conclusions.\n- Potential limitations include open-label design in the SURPASS-3 trial (risk of performance bias) and the focus on short-to-medium-term outcomes (12–52 weeks).\n\n---\n\n**Synthesis of Key Insights and Patterns**  \n- **Tirzepatide demonstrates consistently greater efficacy than both semaglutide and insulin degludec for glycemic control and weight loss, with a dose-dependent effect.**\n- **The safety profile is broadly similar to GLP-1 receptor agonists, with gastrointestinal side effects being the most notable drawback.**\n- **The risk of severe hypoglycemia is low with tirzepatide and semaglutide, and lower than with insulin degludec.**\n- **Weight gain remains a drawback of insulin therapy, while incretin-based therapies offer substantial weight loss benefits.**\n\n---\n\n**Limitations and Gaps Identified**  \n- Long-term cardiovascular and renal outcomes with tirzepatide are still under investigation.\n- Real-world effectiveness and tolerability, especially in populations with multiple comorbidities or older adults, require further study.\n- Direct head-to-head trials between higher doses of tirzepatide and semaglutide (e.g., 15 mg vs. 2.4 mg, the obesity dose) are limited.\n\n---\n\n**Evidence-Based Conclusions**  \n- **Tirzepatide is currently the most effective pharmacological agent for reducing HbA1c and body weight in type 2 diabetes, outperforming both semaglutide and insulin degludec in recent high-quality studies.**\n- **Both tirzepatide and semaglutide are preferable to insulin degludec for patients prioritizing weight loss and minimizing hypoglycemia risk, but gastrointestinal side effects may limit tolerability in some patients.**\n\n---\n\n**Future Research Directions**  \n- Long-term outcome studies on cardiovascular and renal endpoints for tirzepatide.\n- Comparative real-world effectiveness and adherence studies between tirzepatide, semaglutide, and other novel agents.\n- Studies in diverse patient populations, including those with advanced age, multiple comorbidities, or differing baseline body weights.\n\n---\n\n**References**  \n- Karagiannis T. et al., 2024.

CGM has shown consistent benefits in glycemic outcomes in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treated with insulin. Moreover, the combined effect of CGM and education have been shown to improve glycemic outcomes more than CGM alone. Now a CIP is the expected future technology that does not need to be worn all day like insulin pumps and helps to calculate insulin doses with a built-in bolus calculator. Although only a few clinical trials have assessed the effectiveness of CIPs, they consistently show benefits in glycemic outcomes by reducing missed doses of insulin and improving problematic adherence. AID systems and virtual platforms made it possible to achieve target glycosylated hemoglobin in diabetes while minimizing hypoglycemia, which has always been challenging in T1DM. Now fully automatic AID systems and tools for diabetes decisions based on artificial intelligence are in development. These advances in technology could reduce the burden associated with insulin treatment for diabetes.\\n\\n**Keywords:** Artificial intelligence; Blood glucose self-monitoring; Diabetes mellitus, type 1; Technology\\n\\n## INTRODUCTION\\n\\nAchieving target glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) while minimizing hypoglycemia has always been a challenge for diabetes treated with insulin \\\\[ [1](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b1-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. However, technological advances including continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), connected insulin pens (CIPs), insulin pumps, and automated insulin delivery (AID) algorithms combined with education have made it possible to achieve the optimal control of diabetes using insulin ( [Fig. 1](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#f1-dmj-2022-0271)) \\\\[ [2](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b2-dmj-2022-0271), [3](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b3-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. In addition, cloud-based data collection programs can support diabetes and healthcare providers (HCPs) to make the optimal decision easily by offering various data from various devices such as glucose trend data, carbohydrate intake, insulin on board (IOB), and a bolus calculator in one platform \\\\[ [4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b4-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. These are of great importance in improving the glycemic status. These programs can even help to support decision-making by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms \\\\[ [5](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b5-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\].\\n\\n### Fig. 1.\\n\\nImproving glycemic outcomes through continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and its integration with connected insulin pens (CIPs), insulin pumps, automated insulin delivery (AID) algorithms, and virtual glucose monitoring platforms combined with artificial intelligence (AI)-based diabetes management systems.

In addition, we report how they affect glycemic outcomes while minimizing the burden of diabetes management and demonstrate that the greatest benefit occurs when coupled with structured education. We especially focused on CGMs and the new emergence of CIPs. Only the CGM and devices integrated with CGM are outlined here.\\n\\n## CURRENT AND FUTURE CGM TECHNOLOGIES\\n\\n### Present CGM systems\\n\\nThe first CGM system was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1999. The glucose data in this system was blinded to patients or HCP \\\\[ [6](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b6-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. As the glucose levels were not available in real-time, the data were analyzed retrospectively after the use of CGM. Further, the data was only collected for 3 days with poor accuracy. Because of this limited accuracy, the early CGM was approved as an adjuvant to self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) to reduce the number of fingerstick measurements.\\n\\nHowever, the Dexcom G5 (Dexcom, San Diego, CA, USA) reached an accuracy of 9.0% mean absolute relative difference (MARD) similar to the glucose meter devices of MARD below 10%. Thus, in 2016, the FDA approved this as a non-adjunctive device that could replace fingerstick glucose monitoring when making treatment decisions \\\\[ [7](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b7-dmj-2022-0271), [8](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b8-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. This approval has led to other CGMs with similar accuracy. Nowadays, some CGM devices (e.g., Dexcom G6, G7, FreeStyle Libre 1,2,3 \\\\[Abbott Diabetes Care, Alameda, CA, USA\\\\], and Guardian Sensor 4) are precalibrated in the factory, and therefore do not require calibrations to adjust sensor accuracy. In 2021, the definition of professional CGM has changed to devices that are owned and applied in the clinic, regardless of whether the data provided are blinded or unblended \\\\[ [9](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b9-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\].\\n\\nWith the steady improvement in sensor accuracy, duration of wear, and smaller size, the use of CGM is expanding widely. There are several CGM devices in current use, which are summarized in [Table 1](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#t1-dmj-2022-0271). The Dexcom G6 specified for 10-day wear is the first interoperable device with an AID system. It offers accurate readings during euglycemia and even in hypoglycemia without calibration (overall MARD: 10%, in hypoglycemia with glucose level <54 mg/dL and mean absolute differences: 10.8 mg/dL) \\\\[ [10](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b10-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. However, the size (45×30×15 mm) of the device is a bit larger than FreeStyle Libre, and the transmitter and sensor are not combined but separated.\\n\\n#### Table 1.\\n\\nComparison of continuous glucose monitoring systems\\n\\n| | Dexcom G6 | Dexcom G7 | Guardian Sensor 3 | Guardian Sensor 4 | FreeStyle Libre | FreeStyle Libre 2 | FreeStyle Libre 3 | Eversense | Eversense E3 |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| Company | Dexcom | Dexcom | Medtronic | Medtronic | Abbott | Abbott | Abbott | Senseonics | Senseonics |\\n| Size, mm | 45×30×15 | 27.3×24×4.6 | 35×28×9.5 | 35×28×9.5 | 35×5 | 35×5 | 21×2.9 | 18.3×3[a](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tfn1-dmj-2022-0271) | 18.3×3[a](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tfn1-dmj-2022-0271) |\\n| FDA approved year | 2018 | Awaiting | 2018 | Awaiting | 2017 | 2020 | 2022 | 2018 | 2022 |\\n| Approved age | ≥2 years | ≥2 years | ≥2 years | ≥14 years | ≥18 years | ≥4 years | ≥4 years | ≥18 years | ≥18 years |\\n| Sensor type | Real-time | Real-time | Real-time | Real-time | Intermittent scanning | Intermittent scanning | Real-time | Real-time (implantable) | Real-time (implantable) |\\n| Wear time | 10 days | 10.5 days | 7 days | 7 days | 14 days | 14 days | 14 days | 90 days | 180 days |\\n| Warm-up period | 2 hours | 27 minutes | 2 hours | 2 hours | 1 hour | 1 hour | 1 hour | 24 hours | 24 hours |\\n| Calibration required | No | No | Yes (2 times/day) | No | No | No | No | Yes (2 times/day) | Yes (2 times/day for 21 days, 1 time/day after day 21) |\\n| Alarms for hypo/hyperglycemia | Yes | Yes (can be delayed up to 6 hours) | Yes | Yes | No | Yes (optional) | Yes (optional) | Yes (on-body vibration) | Yes (on-body vibration) |\\n| Integrity with insulin pumps | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | Yes | No | No |\\n| Platform | Dexcom clarity | Dexcom clarity | CareLink Personal | CareLink Personal | Libreview | Libreview | Libreview | | |\\n| LibreLinkUp | Eversense DMS | Eversense DMS | | | | | | | |\\n| Accuracy (MARD) | 10.0% | 8.2% (arm), 9.1% (abdomen) | 8.7% (arm), 9.6% (abdomen) | 10.6% | 11.4% (arm) | 9.2% (adults), 9.7% (pediatrics) | 9.2% (adults), 9.7% (pediatrics) | 8.8% | 9.1% |\\n| Accuracy in low glucose range (MAD) | 10.9 mg/dL (glucose level <54 mg/dL) | 8.5 mg/dL (arm), 10.3 mg/dL (abdomen) (glucose level 40–60 mg/dL) | NA | NA | 11.3 mg/dL (glucose level <100 mg/dL) | 9.1 mg/dL (adults), 8.8 mg/dL (pediatrics) | 9.1 mg/dL (adults), 8.8 mg/dL (pediatrics) | NA | 7.5 mg/dL (glucose level ≤60 mg/dL) |\\n| Bluetooth free range | 6 m | 6 m | 6 m | 6 m | NA | NA | 10 m | 7.6 m | 7.6 m |\\n\\nAbbott FreeStyle Libre is an intermittent scanning CGM (isCGM). It is also known as flash glucose monitoring (FGM) which requires scanning for the storage of the glucose value measured and does not provide hypo/hyperglycemia alarms. However, with third-party transmitter devices (e.g., Miao Miao and Bubble Mini), the measured glucose value can be transferred to a smartphone and could be used like a real-time CGM (rtCGM). It is comfortable with a small size sensor (35×5 mm), could be worn up to 14-day long, and does not need calibration. The MARD was estimated to be 11.4%, slightly higher than 10.0% \\\\[ [11](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b11-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. Fortunately, an updated algorithm applied to FreeStyle Libre 2 has been used since 2021 in it, and the MARD achieved 9.2% in adults and 9.7% in pediatrics when the sensor is applied to the upper arm \\\\[ [12](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b12-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\].\\n\\nFreeStyle Libre 2 became available in 2020, it has optional alarms for hypo/hyperglycemia compared to FreeStyle Libre. With the advantage of optional alarms, users can choose to turn the alarm on or off. Another advantage is that the alarm is not consistent when once it is confirmed. Thus, it is suitable for subjects who suffer from alarm fatigue. The sensor accuracy of the MARD was improved as we mentioned above \\\\[ [12](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b12-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. In addition, as with Dexcom G6, the device was approved as an integrated (or interoperable) CGM in August 2021. However, it is still FGM.\\n\\nThe Medtronic Guardian 3 sensor (Medtronic, Northridge, CA, USA) was approved by the FDA in February 2018. However, the device still needs calibration twice a day, and can only be worn for up to 7 days \\\\[ [13](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b13-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. The device integrates with pumps in Medtronics (Minimed 640G, and 670G) but not with others. In May 2021, Medtronics developed the Guardian 4 sensor with the same 7-day duration of wear but requiring no calibrations. The device integrates with newly developed technology, the advanced hybrid closed-loop system (HCLS) MiniMed 780G, and a CIP called InPen \\\\[ [14](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b14-dmj-2022-0271), [15](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b15-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\].\\n\\npatients who have skin reactions to adhesive \\\\[ [9](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b9-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. With Eversense, skin eruption can be reduced by changing the siliconebased adhesive every day.\\n\\n### Future CGM systems\\n\\nThere are potential options for the use of CGM in the management of diabetes in the near future. Dexcom G7 received a CE mark in Europe in March 2022. Compared to the Dexcom G6, Dexcom G7 has several advantages. Dexcom G7 not only has improved in accuracy but has also improved in terms of features and size. It provides more accurate glucose readings than Dexcom G6, in that the overall MARDs for the arm and abdomen were 8.2% and 9.1%, respectively \\\\[ [17](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b17-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. The G7 combined sensor and transmitter in a single body (all-in-one wearable) and is 60% smaller than the Dexcom G6. Skin reaction to an adhesive patch might be reduced by the smaller size of the patch area. The warm-up period was shortened to 27 minutes compared to 2 hours in G6. G7 also has advantages for those who suffer from alarm fatigue because the audible glucose alerts can be disabled for up to 6 hours. The CGM wear time was extended to 10.5 days from 10 days before. Dexcom announced that the FDA submission of the G7 CGM system may expand from a 10- to a 15-day sensor, and this might benefit the cost per device \\\\[ [18](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b18-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\].\\n\\nFollowing the technological trend of rtCGM, Abbott launched FreeStyle Libre 3, which transitioned from isCGM to rtCGM, in March 2022. It was cleared for a CE mark in September 2020, and FDA approval in May 2022. The device is now only available in the UK at the timing of writing. Compared to FreeStyle Libre2, the size has been reduced by more than 70%. It has the same accuracy and the same length of wear time (14 days) as FreeStyle Libre 2 \\\\[ [12](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b12-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\].\\n\\nEversense E3 could be implanted for 180 days and received a CE mark in June 2020. In February 2022, the FDA also approved it and now it is available in the USA. Although the sensor time is increased up to 180 days (6 months), a disadvantage is that calibration is still required \\\\[ [19](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b19-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. Fortunately, the number of calibrations reduces from 2 times/day for 21 days, to 1 time/day after day 21.\\n\\nWe anticipate that future diabetes technology with non-invasive CGM could be worn on the wrist. Recently, HGR GWave, non-invasive radiofrequency sensing, showed accurate results in five subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The HGR readings had a high correlation with glucose measurements at _R_ 2=0.924 ( _P_ <0.0001) \\\\[ [20](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b20-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. Further clinical studies are needed to facilitate the use of non-invasive radiofrequency sensing for diabetes in actual practice.\\n\\n## GLYCEMIC EFFICACY OF CGM ITSELF\\n\\nCGM has emerged as a useful tool to assess glycemic status and is consistently proved to be effective compared to SMBG alone in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and T2DM who are receiving insulin-based therapy \\\\[ [21](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b21-dmj-2022-0271)- [24](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b24-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. Thus, we have reviewed the efficacy of different CGM systems (rtCGM vs. isCGM) with populations of different glycemic statuses to assist clinicians more comprehensively and provide guidance in the selection of an appropriate CGM. Two types of CGM are available: rtCGM and isCGM. In general, CGM refers to rtCGM that allows individuals to visualize real-time data in 1 to 5 minutes. IsCGM is referred to as FGM because the glucose value can only be seen by scanning the sensor; thus, it is regarded as a separate entity from CGM. As the glucose monitoring methods are different, they also have different glycemic effects.\\n\\nThe effectiveness of rtCGM has been confirmed in various randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with different types of diabetes and insulin regimens ( [Table 2](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#t2-dmj-2022-0271)). The glycemic outcome was different based on the glycemic status of the study population included. Studies showed that rtCGM had a beneficial effect on reducing HbA1c, particularly in patients with markedly high HbA1c, and on reducing hypoglycemia, especially in patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia. In studies with T1DM and T2DM both were poorly controlled using multiple daily injections (MDI; DIAMOND and GOLD), regardless of the type of diabetes, the rtCGM had the advantage of reducing HbA1c by 0.3% to 0.6% more than non-CGM users \\\\[ [21](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b21-dmj-2022-0271)- [23](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b23-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. Specifically, in a study evaluating the HbA1c reduction in T1DM using MDI with a mean HbA1c of 8.6%, the mean differences of time in range (TIR, 70 to 180 mg/dL) were 5.4% (77 minutes/day) between the rtCGM and SMBG groups ( _P_ =0.005) \\\\[ [21](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b21-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. Also, the time below range (TBR, <70 mg/dL) decreased from 4.5% to 3.0% at week 24 in the rtCGM users. Unfortunately, the T2DM trials did not show differences in hypoglycemia between the groups \\\\[ [23](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b23-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\].\\n\\n### Table 2.\\n\\nRandomized controlled studies providing evidence of glycemic efficacy of rtCGM\\n\\n| Study | Study design | Study population | Diabetes type | Insulin regimen | Baseline glycemic status (CGM vs. SMBG) | Primary outcomes | Results (CGM vs. SMBG) |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| Lind et al.

These results are from the included participants, who were patients with a high risk for hypoglycemia and with relatively lower portion of high HbA1c (with HbA1c lower than 9.0%). Thus, it is natural that hypoglycemic events were significantly reduced with the relatively high portion of hypoglycemia, and it is also natural that there’re were no differences in hyperglycemia between the groups because of the relatively lower portion of individuals with high HbA1c \\\\[ [25](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b25-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\].\\n\\nTrials were conducted on the effectiveness of rtCGM for treating T2DM with basal insulin and not MDI \\\\[ [24](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b24-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. The study population included HbA1c between 7.8% to 11.5%, with a mean HbA1c of 9.0% for both the rtCGM and SMBG groups. The mean HbA1c level decreased to 8.0% in the rtCGM group with a mean adjusted difference of –0.4% ( _P_ =0.02) between the CGM and the SMBG group. The results were similar to those of the study of populations using MDI. Interestingly, they also explored the effect of discontinuing rtCGM after 8 months in the same population of T2DM using basal insulin \\\\[ [26](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b26-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. In the study, TIR increased from 38% to 62% after 8 months of CGM use but decreased after discontinuing CGM to 50% at 14 months (mean change from 8 to 14 months –12%, _P_ =0.01), emphasizing the importance of consistent CGM use.\\n\\nThe glycemic outcomes from isCGM and rtCGM are different. The RCT outcomes of isCGM are listed in [Table 3](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#t3-dmj-2022-0271). There are not many studies for isCGM, isCGM did not show an HbA1c reduction even in a study with poorly controlled diabetes (HbA1c range, 7.5% to 12.0%) \\\\[ [27](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b27-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. Although the isCGM does not have the ability to reduce HbA1c, it still can be used to avoid hypoglycemia \\\\[ [28](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b28-dmj-2022-0271), [29](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b29-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\].\\n\\n### Table 3.\\n\\nRandomized controlled studies providing evidence of glycemic efficacy of isCGM\\n\\n| Study | Study design | Study population | Diabetes type | Insulin regimen | Baseline glycemic status (CGM vs. SMBG) | Primary outcomes | Results (CGM vs. SMBG) |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| Bolinder et al.

In a meta-analysis identifying 15 RCTs involving 2,461 patients, rtCGM led to higher improvements in mean HbA1c (0.23%) and TIR (5.8%), whereas isCGM was associated with a greater decline in TBR \\\\[ [31](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b31-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. However, this meta-analysis was performed without considering the purpose and baseline characteristics of the study. In studies aimed at improving HbA1c or TIR, poorly controlled diabetes with high HbA1c were enrolled, but in the case of hypoglycemia prevention, subjects with a high risk of hypoglycemia were enrolled rather than subjects with a high level of HbA1c. It is relatively difficult to show a decrease in HbA1c in studies seeking to prevent hypoglycemia in a well-controlled population. Therefore, considering that the study differs HbA1c at entry, and differs primary outcomes, meta-analyses should be divided into the studies with HbA1c near target with the primary outcome of reduction in hypoglycemia, and high HbA1c with primary outcome of HbA1c reduction, separately \\\\[ [32](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b32-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\].\\n\\n## EFFECT OF EDUCATION ON CGM USE\\n\\nThe use of rtCGM reduces HbA1c by about 0.3% to 0.6% \\\\[ [33](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b33-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. Beck et al. \\\\[ [21](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b21-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\] revealed that the HbA1c was 0.6% lower, and TIR was 5.3% (1.28 hour/day) higher in the rtCGM group than in the control group with poorly controlled T1DM. However, despite the benefits of rtCGM itself, subjects in the rtCGM group did not achieve the target of HbA1c <7.0% and TIR >70%. HbA1c and TIR only achieved 7.7% and 51.1% (12.3 hours/day), respectively. The use of rtCGM without education limits better glycemic outcomes.\\n\\nToday, structured education specifically for CGM has been recognized as an essential part of diabetes therapy. By increasing the ability of the patient to adjust the insulin dose rather than using fixed-dose insulin, an additional glycemic improvement can be achieved. Several studies have noted the importance and effectiveness of education \\\\[ [34](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b34-dmj-2022-0271)- [38](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b38-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. Yoo et al. \\\\[ [38](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b38-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\] emphasized personalized education in a study comparing the efficacy of rtCGM combined with structured education or without education. In an RCT, participants with 3 months of structured education had a 15.3% (3 hours 42 min/day) increase in TIR compared with the control group. These results showed remarkable increases in TIR than in a previous study that used rtCGM without education. The group with education had a more HbA1c decrease of 0.5% compared to those without education. The HbA1c changed from 8.4% to 7.2%, nearly achieving an HbA1c of 7.0%. Studies with very young children and with children had similar results \\\\[ [34](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b34-dmj-2022-0271), [36](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b36-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\].\\n\\nRCT studies showed that isCGM has high efficacy in reducing hypoglycemia whereas it does not improve HbA1c. However, users educated in isCGM improve glycemic outcomes. Hermanns et al. \\\\[ [35](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b35-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\] showed a significant difference of –0.17% reduction in the HbA1c of an isCGM with education group compared to the isCGM without education. In addition, Yaron et al. \\\\[ [37](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b37-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\] reported a 0.82% reduction of HbA1c for 10 weeks in isCGM users who had attended education for insulin dose adjustment.\\n\\n## EFFECTS OF CGM INTEGRATION WITH OTHER DEVICES\\n\\n### Currently available and future CIPs with CGM\\n\\nA missed insulin injection, inappropriate timing of injection, and problematic adherence in patients with insulin-based therapy are common and have always been challenging \\\\[ [39](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b39-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\].

Currently, a few clinical trials are collecting data on the effectiveness of these CIPs.\\n\\nAn overview of the characteristics of CIPs and smart cap integrating with CGM is summarized in [Table 4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#t4-dmj-2022-0271). In 2017, the Medtronic InPen (Companion Medical, San Diego, CA, USA) became the first FDA-approved CIP \\\\[ [44](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b44-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. The InPen, a Bluetooth-enabled wireless insulin pen, has functions that not only memorize the number of doses and timing of insulin injections in rapid acting insulin but it also has a bolus calculator and IOB display like insulin pumps. The display of injection timing with IOB helps to prevent insulin stacking. With the bolus calculator, the users can calculate the appropriate doses easier, like pump users. Thus, a device with the bolus calculator function, not limited to InPen, can be a good choice for patients with diabetes who want to optimize bolus doses with correction factors (CF), insulin-carbohydrate ratio (ICR), and duration of insulin actions, but are hesitant about always attaching the devices. The bolus calculator in the mobile app of InPen also has a simple version like ‘meal size estimation (small, medium, or large)’ for individuals with diabetes who are unfamiliar with carbohydrate counting. It also has alerts for injection reminders to help avoid injection omission.\\n\\n#### Table 4.\\n\\nComparison of present and future connected insulin pens and caps integrated with CGM\\n\\n| | Pen * * * | Caps * * * |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| InPen | NovoPen6/Echo Plus | DIA:CONN P8 | Bigfoot Unity |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| Company | Medtronics | NovoNordisk | G2E | Bigfoot Biomedical |\\n| FDA approved | 2017 | Not yet | Not yet | 2021 |\\n| Approval age | ≥7 years | Not yet | Not yet | ≥12 years |\\n| Integrated CGM | Guardian Connect, Guardian 4 sensor | Not directly (CGM those available with Glooko/Diasend) | Dexcom, FreeStyle Libre, i-sense | FreeStyle Libre 2 (later with FreeStyle Libre 3) |\\n| Available insulins[a](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tfn3-dmj-2022-0271) | Humalog, Novolog, Fiasp | Cartridges by Novo Nordisk (Novolog, Fiasp, Levemir, Degludec) | Long-acting insulin, rapid acting insulin[b](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tfn4-dmj-2022-0271) | Black for rapid-acting insulin (Humalog, Novolog); White for long-acting insulin (Lantus, Tresiba) |\\n| Maximum insulin dose | 30 units | 60/30 units | 300 units | NA |\\n| Dose increments | 0.5 unit | 1/0.5 unit | 0.1 unit | NA |\\n| Insulin injection reminder | Yes (rapid and long-acting insulin) | No | Yes | Yes |\\n| Last injection time and dose | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\\n| Bolus calculator | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |\\n| IOB display | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |\\n| Alarms | Yes (2 hours after rapid-acting insulin, cartridge replaced after 28 days) | No | Yes | <70 mg/dL (optional) |\\n| | | <55 mg/dL (Mandatory) |\\n| | | Missing basal dose more than 24 hours |\\n| Battery life | 1 year | 5 years | Not yet | 1 year |\\n| Software | Bluetooth | NFC | Bluetooth | Bluetooth |\\n\\nThe benefit of the CIP is not only in diabetes, but it also helps HCPs to make better decisions in diabetes management by engaging diabetes with correct insulin use information \\\\[ [45](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b45-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. With the CIP, there is no need to make decisions about insulin doses, timing, or the number of insulin injections based on a presumption that the patient is following the insulin prescription. Data from the device integrate with CGM in one platform. Thus, with a CIP, the glucose values and the amount of carbohydrate intake, and the amount and time of the insulin dose can be seen at a glance. The importance of the device is the benefits in glycemic outcomes, but the number of studies is limited. Vigersky et al. \\\\[ [46](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b46-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\] reported an increase in TIR of 2.3% (0.6 hour/day) and a decrease in time above range (TAR >180 mg/dL) of 2.4%, with no change in TBR in the InPen users compared to pre-InPen use in poorly controlled T1DM (glucose management indicator >8.0%) when combined with CGM.\\n\\nNovoPen 6 and NovoPen Echo Plus by Novo Nordisk (Bagsværd, Denmark) are CIPs similar to InPen; they automatically memorize insulin doses and timing and further integrate with CGM. The devices have not yet been cleared by the FDA \\\\[ [42](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b42-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. Compared to InPen, which works with Bluetooth, the Novopen 6/Echo Plus works with near-field communication technology. In addition, the battery life of the Novopen6/Echo Plus (5 years) is much longer than those of InPen (1 year) without recharging. In collaboration with Glooko/Diasend (Gothenburg, Sweden) digital diabetes management platforms, the information obtained by NovePen6/Echo Plus can be integrated with various CGMs available in Glooko. However, it does not offer injection reminders or IOB display. Two observation studies have evaluated the efficacy of NovoPen 6 integrating with CGM, one in adults and the other in pediatric patients \\\\[ [42](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b42-dmj-2022-0271), [43](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b43-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. Adolfsson et al. \\\\[ [42](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b42-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\] revealed significant changes during the 12-month follow-up period, with an 8.5% (1.9 hour/day) increase of TIR, 6.2% decrease of TAR (>180 mg/dL, 1.8 hour/day), and 1.5% TBR (<54 mg/dL, 0.3 hour/day) in 94 patients with T1DM. They also found that missed bolus dose (MBD) injections decreased by 43% over the study ( _P_ =0.0002). In another study, they found that the TBR (<54 mg/dL) reduces by 0.64% from 2.82% to 2.18% in at least 12 months of follow-up in 39 pediatric patients with T1DM. However, there were no changes in MBD meals, TIR, and TAR (>180 mg/dL) \\\\[ [43](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b43-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\].\\n\\nBigfoot Biomedical received FDA approval as a diabetes management system featuring connected insulin caps for an insulin pen in 2021 \\\\[ [47](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b47-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. It is the only smart cap solution that works with disposable insulin pens integrated with FreeStyle Libre 2, and it will also be available with FreesStyle Libre 3 soon. It has similar features to the InPen. It offers a bolus calculator, IOB display, missed dose reminder, and hypoglycemia alarm and combines this with the Bigfoot Unity mobile app. Caps are available for both basal and rapid-acting insulins compared to the InPen, which only has rapid-acting insulins. There are two smart pen caps, a white one for rapid-acting (bolus) insulin and a black one for long-acting (basal) insulin. Data for both rapid-acting insulins and long-acting insulins are presented in one place in the Bigfoot Unity mobile app. Lilly launched the Tempo pen and a small smart button device that attaches to a prefilled tempo pen \\\\[ [41](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b41-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. A study has shown the benefits of the smart button integrated with rtCGM (Dexcom G5) in TIR, TAR, and TBR, and also in MBD \\\\[ [41](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b41-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. It was a 12-week, single-arm, exploratory, two-period study for subjects with T1DM ( _n_ =38) or T2DM ( _n_ =26). MBD significantly decreased from 0.74 to 0.62 MBD/day ( _P_ =0.008). In addition, TAR, TBR, and mean HbA1c decreased from 53.6% to 48.1% ( _P_ =0.004), from 4.49% to 2.93% ( _P_ <0.001), and from 8.8% to 8.4% ( _P_ <0.001), respectively. TIR also increased significantly from 41.9% to 49.0% ( _P_ <0.001).\\n\\nWe have reviewed the CIPs and caps that are currently on the market, and several are expected to be on the market soon. Diaconn (Seoul, Korea) P8 of the CIP by G2E, and SoloSmart Mini \\\\[ [48](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b48-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\] of smart caps by Sanofi (Paris, France) are also in development. SoloSmart Mini is a reusable insulin pen cap that enables the recording of insulin doses and the timing of injections. The SoloSmart Mini will be launched in Korea at the end of 2022. Diaconn P8 allows 0.1-unit increments of dosing and a bolus maximum of 300 units with various insulin cartridges and CGMs. The device has an in-built bolus calculator, IOB, and last doses of insulin injections on display. As with the CIP by Bigfoot Biomedical, they have separate pens for basal and rapid-acting insulins. Both CIP and insulin pump of G2E can be linked with and can be shown in just one App, thus users can switch the two devices flexibly whenever the user wants.\\n\\nWith the growing evidence on CIP efficacy, in 2022, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology 2021 \\\\[ [49](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b49-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\] and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) \\\\[ [9](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b9-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\] announced that the insulin pen can be helpful for diabetes management and may be used in patients using injectable therapy.\\n\\n### Currently available and future insulin pumps with CGM\\n\\nIncreasing evidence demonstrates the effectiveness of insulin pumps when used in combination with a CGM and closedloop algorithm controller to automate basal insulin delivery, these are known as HCLS \\\\[ [50](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b50-dmj-2022-0271)- [52](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b52-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\].

Of these devices, the clinical benefits of advanced HCLS (AHCLS) are among the highlights. AHCLS differs from HCLS, which modulates basal insulin delivery but does not administer automated correction boluses. AHCLS has an additional function with automated bolus correction. Medtronic MiniMed 780G is the first AHCLS which includes a target set point of 100 or 120 mg/dL and an automated correction bolus feature up to every 5 minutes. The RCT showed 12.5% higher TIR in AHCLS compared to the sensor augmented pump (SAP) therapy with predictive low-glucose suspend (PLGS, 70.4% vs. 57.9%, _P_ <0.001) in 59 patients with T1DM previously using insulin pump therapy \\\\[ [54](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b54-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. Recently in a single-arm prospective study involving 157 adolescents and adults with T1DM, the study revealed an additional increase in TIR of 5.7% (increased from 68.8% to 74.5%, _P_ <0.001) as a result of conversion from SAP with PLGS to AHCLS for 3 months \\\\[ [55](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b55-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. Compared with the run-in period, AHCLS reduced HbA1c from 7.5% to 7.0%, a decrease of 0.5%, and TBR (<70 mg/dL) decreased from 3.3% to 2.3% (all _P_ <0.001). In addition, when the target was set to 100 mg/dL, TIR increased to 75.4%. The results were similar in other prospective single-arm study with 34 children and adolescents for 12 weeks of treatment \\\\[ [56](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b56-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. Glycemic efficacy in the study was different because the study population was consisted of T1DM with MDI therapy, not insulin pumps before the study entry. Furthermore, 10 days of education was added. Remarkably, TIR increased from 42.1% at baseline to 78.8% in the study phase ( _P_ <0.001). HbA1c decreased from 8.6% at baseline to 6.5% at the end of the study ( _P_ =0.001). Thus, with the advance in technology and structured education, the glycemic outcomes could be remarkably improved even when the patients have less burden with automated bolus correction. We await the results of the Advanced Hybrid Closed-Loop in an Adult Population with Type 1 Diabetes (ADAPT) study comparing AHCLS to CGM with MDI \\\\[ [57](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b57-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\].\\n\\nAlthough not as sophisticated as the MiniMed 780G, the Tandem T:slim X2 also performs bolus correction every hour, so it is sometimes classified as AHCLP. Existing RCTs also consistently showed an 11% TIR increase compared to SAP \\\\[ [51](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b51-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. For the entire 12-month observation of a real-world study of 9,451 users of the t:slim X2 insulin pump with Control-IQ technology, TIR increased from 63.6% to 73.6%, exceeding the target value of TIR 70% with no increase in hypoglycemia (TBR <70 mg/dL: <1%) \\\\[ [58](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b58-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\].\\n\\nThe Insulet Omnipod 5 (Insulet, Acton, MA, USA) is in the spotlight as the first tubeless patch pump with an algorithm in the pod that has FDA approval, although it is still HCLS, which does not have bolus auto-correction. The tubeless patch pump, as the name suggests, has several advantages, for example, it does not have a long tube line and it is in the form of a small patch, giving the convenience of wearing comfort. A multicenter prospective study involving 235 patients with T1DM resulted in a 0.71% HbA1c reduction in children and a 0.38% reduction in adults \\\\[ [59](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b59-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. In addition, TIR was improved from standard therapy by 15.6% (3.7 hours/day) in children and 9.3% (2.2 hours/day) in adults (both _P_ <0.0001). A study for very young children also showed similar results \\\\[ [60](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b60-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\].\\n\\nThe insulin-only iLet Bionic Pancreas (Beta Bionics, Irvine, CA, USA) with greater automation can significantly reduce the burden of T1DM and also showed good results in the ADA conference of 2022 \\\\[ [61](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b61-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. It differs from currently marketed artificial pancreas systems (APSs) in that users do not need exact carbohydrate counting, just simple input such as “typical, larger, or smaller meals than usual.” In addition, users only need to enter their body weight to initialize the system with no run-in period before automation. In that the ultimate goal of the AID system is to reduce the burden of T1DM through full automation, this device is closer to the future. The study comparing iLet Bionic Pancreas (integrated with Dexcom G6) to a standard of care involving currently available APS or SAP integrated with CGM or MDI with CGMs, showed the benefits for 440 adults and children with higher HbA1c levels during 13 weeks of treatment. In the iLet group, the HbA1c changed from 7.6% to 7.1%, and the mean difference between the iLet and control group was 0.5% ( _P_ <0.001). The TIR was 11% (2.6 hours/day) higher than the control group ( _P_ <0.001). There was no difference in TBR <54 mg/dL in both groups, but all groups achieved the target below 1%. However, even in patients with poorly controlled diabetes, at the study end, TIR was only 69% in adults, so caution is needed in selecting this iLet Bionic Pancreas for those with well-controlled diabetes.\\n\\n### Do-it-yourself closed-loop systems with CGM\\n\\nDo-it-yourself closed-loop (DIY) systems are open-source algorithms designed to automate insulin delivery that link to existing CGMs and insulin pumps. These systems were created before the first commercial AID systems received FDA approval in 2016 by an online community (non-profit organization) who were directly related to diabetes. Thus, are freely available on the internet by app and are easily accessible. However, since they have not received FDA approval, they cannot be prescribed by the HCP and the patient has to take full responsibility for the failure of DIY. There are three types of DIY available: Open APS, Android APS, and Loop. Android APS does not require additional hardware except with Medtronic pumps or Omnipod; however, Open APS and Loop require additional hardware called “Rig” and “Riley Link,” respectively.\\n\\nThe evidence of safety and effectiveness from real-world studies is growing \\\\[ [62](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b62-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. In these studies, the glycemic efficacy is similar to commercially available systems \\\\[ [63](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b63-dmj-2022-0271)- [65](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b65-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. A prospective real-world study for the safety and effectiveness of the Tidepool Loop (Tidepool, Palo Alto, CA, USA) open-source AID system was published \\\\[ [64](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b64-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. The TIR increased from 67% to 73% over 6 months and decreased severe hypoglycemia (TBR <54 mg/dL) by 0.05% (All _P_ <0.01). Mean HbA1c decreased with a mean difference of 0.33%, even in subjects with a mean HbA1c of 6.8%. With this growing evidence, Tidepool has submitted the Loop algorithms to the FDA to build a commercial version. We hope that these DIYs will be FDA-approved and used more safely. Recently, the first RCT comparing Android APS to SAP was shown at the ADA 2022 conference. The mean TIR was 74.5% using Android APS achieving the TIR of 70%, but only 56.4% was shown in the SAP group \\\\[ [66](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b66-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\].\\n\\n## GLYCEMIC MONITORING PLATFORMS\\n\\nFactors that have greatly improved glycemic status include CGM, an AID system, CIPs, and structured education programs but the area of particular importance is a glycemic monitoring platform \\\\[ [67](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b67-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. It collects the data from all of the above and allows the HCP and patients to see various and accurate information at a glance. This helps both the patients and HCPs to make better decisions for glycemic improvement by recommending the optimal basal rate, CF, and ICR \\\\[ [68](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b68-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. These cloud-based data collection programs include Tidepool, Glooko/Diasend, Jade Diabetes (Victoria, Australia), and MySugar (Vienna, Austria) available worldwide, and Diaconn web only available in Korea.\\n\\nThese free online platforms allow the user to integrate with various types of CGM, glucose meters, insulin pumps, and CIPs. Large companies such as Glooko/Diasend and Tidepool have similar abilities to provide glucose trends, amount of carbohydrate intake, basal and bolus dosages, exercise, and other biometric factors. However, the device compatibility is different. Both Glooko/Diasend and Tidepool integrate with CGMs by Dexcom and Abbott and insulin pumps by Insulet, Tandem, and Medtronics, and CIPs from Medtronics InPen. The Glooko/Diasend does not support CGMs by Medtronics (e.g., Guardian connect, Guardian 3 sensor), on the other hand, Tidepool does not support CIPs from Novo Nordisk (Novopen 6/Echo plus). Diaconn web is organized by G2E and only available in South Korea. The platform has similar abilities to Glooko in reporting data. However, they only support their own insulin pump (Diaconn G8) and CIP (Diaconn P8), and other CGMs of Dexcom G6, and FreeStyle Libre with a thirdparty transmitter. Jade Diabetes recently launched the voice-based insulin dosing system, Alexa.\\n\\n## THE FUTURE OF DIABETES THERAPY INTEGRATED WITH CGM\\n\\nThe advancement of CGM has enabled a complete glucose profile to be obtained, thus making it possible to diagnose the glycemic status of an individual precisely. The device is getting smaller, more comfortable to wear, accurate, and even non-invasive glucose monitoring technologies are in development \\\\[ [69](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b69-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. In addition, the advancement of the AID system and CIP integrated with CGM has reduced the burden of T1DM by overcoming the time consumed on insulin management. The development of diabetes technology made it possible to avoid hyperglycemia without increasing hypoglycemia with a more comfortable fit and less effort, which could not previously be shown in diabetes with insulin therapy \\\\[ [70](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b70-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\].\\n\\nIn the future, we expect that a fully automatic AID system will emerge, just as Bionic Pancreas has developed no carbohydrate counting pumps, which was previously burdensome for users. However, most of the HCLS still need to modify a variety of parameters including carbohydrate counting, and these require expertise and experience from the HCP. Thus, as there is a platform where you can see various technologies in one place, it is necessary to develop a decision support tool that can help with complex insulin dose calculating over a short time through that platform for optimal management. Indeed, Glooko has made a digital decision support system called DreaMed Advisor Pro (DreaMed Diabetes Ltd., Petah Tikva, Israel) which automatically provides the exact insulin dosing recommendations and other treatment tips through an AI-based algorithm \\\\[ [71](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#b71-dmj-2022-0271)\\\\]. In a study comparing physicians to DreaMed Advisor Pro in insulin dose adjustment, the changes in insulin dosing were similar to those given by the physicians.\\n\\n## CONCLUSIONS\\n\\nIt has become possible to fully diagnose an individual glycemic status through rapidly evolving CGM technology. CGM use is growing exponentially with valuable benefits on clinical outcomes, furthermore, various technologies can be integrated with it. These complex bunch of data including glucose trend, amount of carbohydrate intake, IOB, and physical activity are summarized in a virtual platform, which helps the HCP and patients with diabetes easily analyze and helps diagnose the glycemic status. This has resulted in a dramatic improvement in glycemic control. There is no doubt that evolving diabetes technology has changed the treatment paradigm for patients with diabetes using insulin treatment and reduced the burden of diabetes self-management such as the adjustment of insulin dosing. However, the burden of the disease is significant. Despite the technological advances, accessing new technology with complexity and rapid changes could be a burden to some patients if it is not fully automated. Thus, in the future, we expect the CGM to be smaller, more comfortable, last longer, and, importantly, be more accurate. In addition, we expect the advancement of the AID system with a fully automatic algorithm according to the meaning of the term “artificial pancreas system,” which no longer needs carbohydrate counting or meal estimation. Currently, all the information from the CGM and integrated devices are connected to the virtual platform, but a tool for decision support is in development, so the vast information may feel rather complicated. Thus, constant efforts for developing AI-based personalized decision support such as DreaMed advisor, which recommends adjustments to the CF, ICR, and basal rate automatically, are needed to optimize insulin use in diabetes aiming to accomplish the greatest TIR with no hypoglycemia.\\n\\n## Acknowledgments\\n\\nNone\\n\\n## Footnotes\\n\\n**CONFLICTS OF INTEREST**\\n\\nNo potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported.\\n\\n## REFERENCES\\n\\n- 1.Yoo JH, Kim JH.

These innovations collectively aim to improve glycemic outcomes, reduce the burden of daily diabetes management, and move toward fully automated, user-friendly solutions.\n\n---\n\n**Introduction**  \nThe landscape of diabetes management has rapidly evolved with the introduction of new technologies that automate and simplify glucose monitoring and insulin delivery. The focus of this synthesis is on technologies released in the past two years, particularly continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and artificial pancreas systems, and their clinical impact.\n\n---\n\n**Main Findings by Theme**\n\n1. **Advances in Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)**\n   - **Technological Improvements:**  \n     Recent CGM systems (e.g., Dexcom G7, FreeStyle Libre 3, Guardian Sensor 4, Eversense E3) have achieved higher accuracy (MARD often <10%), longer wear times (up to 14 days for transcutaneous and 180 days for implantable sensors), and smaller device sizes, enhancing user comfort and adherence (Source: [PMC9925143](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9925143/)).\n   - **Clinical Impact:**  \n     CGM use, especially real-time CGM (rtCGM), consistently improves glycemic outcomes in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, with reductions in HbA1c of 0.3–0.6% and increased time in range (TIR). The benefit is maximized when combined with structured education.\n   - **Emerging Technologies:**  \n     Non-invasive CGMs (e.g., HGR GWave) are in early-stage trials, showing promise for future, less burdensome glucose monitoring.\n\n2. **Automated Insulin Delivery and Artificial Pancreas Systems**\n   - **iLet Bionic Pancreas:**  \n     The iLet Bionic Pancreas (Beta Bionics, 2023/2024) represents a new generation of automated insulin delivery. It requires only the user’s weight to initialize and eliminates the need for user input on carb counting, correction factors, or basal rates, thus reducing cognitive and management burden ([Betabionics iLet](https://www.betabionics.com/ilet-bionic-pancreas/)). Early clinical data show significant improvements in HbA1c and TIR compared to standard care.\n   - **Other AID Systems:**  \n     Advanced hybrid closed-loop systems (e.g., Medtronic MiniMed 780G, Tandem t:slim X2 with Control-IQ, Insulet Omnipod 5) offer automated basal and bolus insulin adjustments, further improving glycemic control. These systems have been released or updated in the past two years, with robust evidence supporting their efficacy.\n   - **Do-It-Yourself (DIY) AID:**  \n     Open-source solutions (e.g., AndroidAPS, Loop) continue to gain traction, with real-world and RCT evidence showing glycemic outcomes comparable to commercial systems, though they lack regulatory approval.\n\n3. **Connected Insulin Pens (CIPs) and Integration**\n   - **Recent Developments:**  \n     New CIPs (e.g., Medtronic InPen, NovoPen 6/Echo Plus, Bigfoot Unity) now integrate directly with CGMs and digital platforms, providing features such as dose tracking, reminders, bolus calculators, and real-time data sharing.\n   - **Clinical Outcomes:**  \n     CIPs have demonstrated reductions in missed doses, improved adherence, and modest improvements in glycemic outcomes, especially when data are integrated with CGM platforms.\n   - **AI-Based Decision Support:**  \n     AI-driven platforms (e.g., DreaMed Advisor Pro) are being developed to provide personalized insulin dosing recommendations, showing similar efficacy to expert clinicians in initial studies.\n\n4. **Virtual Platforms and Data Integration**\n   - **Comprehensive Management:**  \n     Platforms like Tidepool, Glooko/Diasend, and proprietary apps now aggregate data from CGMs, insulin pumps, and CIPs, enabling both patients and healthcare providers to make informed, data-driven decisions.\n\n---\n\n**Critical Analysis of Evidence Quality**  \n- **Source Reliability:**  \n  The primary source ([PMC9925143](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9925143/)) is a recent, peer-reviewed, comprehensive review published in 2023, ensuring high credibility. The iLet Bionic Pancreas information comes from the manufacturer’s website, which, while authoritative for device features, should be supplemented by peer-reviewed clinical trial data for efficacy claims.\n- **Evidence Hierarchy:**  \n  Findings are supported by randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews, and meta-analyses, particularly for CGM and AID efficacy.\n- **Limitations:**  \n  - Some newer technologies (e.g., non-invasive CGMs, AI decision tools) are still in early clinical development, with limited large-scale outcome data.\n  - Manufacturer claims for devices like the iLet require further independent validation.\n  - Real-world adoption may be limited by cost, access, and user education.\n\n---\n\n**Synthesis of Key Insights and Patterns**\n- The convergence of accurate, user-friendly CGMs, fully automated insulin delivery, and integrated digital platforms is rapidly transforming diabetes management.\n- Structured education remains critical for maximizing benefits, even as automation increases.\n- AI-based decision support is emerging as a key enabler for personalized care.\n- The trend is toward minimal user input, with systems like the iLet Bionic Pancreas representing a paradigm shift toward “hands-off” diabetes management.\n\n---\n\n**Limitations and Gaps**\n- **Clinical Evidence:**  \n  Long-term, real-world effectiveness and safety data for the newest devices (especially those released in the last 1–2 years) are still emerging.\n- **Access and Equity:**  \n  High costs and insurance coverage limitations may restrict access to the latest technologies.\n- **Complexity:**  \n  Despite automation, the rapid evolution and proliferation of device options may create confusion or overwhelm some users and providers.\n\n---\n\n**Evidence-Based Conclusions**\n- New diabetes management technologies released in the past two years—particularly next-generation CGMs, fully automated AID systems like the iLet Bionic Pancreas, and advanced CIPs—offer substantial improvements in glycemic outcomes and user experience.\n- The integration of these devices with AI-driven platforms and virtual data ecosystems is enabling more precise, less burdensome, and increasingly automated diabetes care.\n- The greatest clinical benefit is seen when these technologies are combined with structured patient education and support.\n\n---\n\n**Future Research Directions**\n- Large-scale, long-term comparative effectiveness studies of new CGMs, AID systems, and integrated platforms.\n- Evaluation of AI-based decision support tools in diverse patient populations.\n- Studies on cost-effectiveness, access, and health equity related to adoption of advanced diabetes technologies.\n- Development and validation of fully non-invasive glucose monitoring systems.\n\n---\n\n**Errors or Issues Identified**\n- The tool output’s summary incorrectly stated that the document \"does not specify technologies released in the past 2 years.\" In fact, the primary source and the iLet Bionic Pancreas both describe devices and systems that have been released or substantially updated within the last two years.\n- Manufacturer website information (iLet Bionic Pancreas) lacks peer-reviewed clinical outcome data in this output and should be interpreted with appropriate caution.\n\n---\n\n**References**  \n- [Advances in Continuous Glucose Monitoring and Integrated Devices](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9925143/)\n- [iLet Bionic Pancreas by Beta Bionics](https://www.betabionics.com/ilet-bionic-pancreas/)\n\n---\n\n**For actionable insights or further detail on specific devices, clinical outcomes, or implementation strategies, additional targeted research is recommended.**\n<thinking>\nI need to analyze the tool execution output, which contains multiple searches related to diabetes treatments, guidelines, and technology. The output includes information on:\n\n1. Emerging experimental treatments and clinical trials for diabetes\n2. Latest FDA-approved medications and treatment options for Type 1 diabetes (2023-2024)\n3. Current ADA and international diabetes organizations guidelines (2024)\n4. Most effective Type 2 diabetes treatments with comparative efficacy data\n5. New diabetes management technologies including CGMs and artificial pancreas systems\n\nThe output is extensive and contains detailed information from credible sources including FDA announcements, clinical trials, systematic reviews, and official guidelines. I'll need to synthesize this information into a clear, concise summary that highlights the most relevant findings across these areas while maintaining accuracy.\n</thinking>\n\n# Comprehensive Overview of Recent Advances in Diabetes Management (2023-2024)\n\n## Emerging Treatments and Clinical Trials\n\n### Cellular Therapies\n- **Lantidra** (FDA approved June 2023): First allogeneic pancreatic islet cellular therapy for type 1 diabetes patients with severe hypoglycemia despite intensive management.
