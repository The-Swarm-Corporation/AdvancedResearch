A systematic evaluation of the literature since 2014 informed new recommendations. These include additional focus on lifestyle management and diabetes self-management education and support. For those with obesity, efforts targeting weight loss, including lifestyle, medication and surgical interventions, are recommended. With regards to medication management, for patients with clinical cardiovascular disease, a sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist with proven cardiovascular benefit is recommended. For patients with chronic kidney disease or clinical heart failure and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven benefit is recommended. GLP-1 receptor agonists are generally recommended as the first injectable medication.\\n\\n### Similar content being viewed by others\\n\\n### Explore related subjects\\n\\nDiscover the latest articles and news from researchers in related subjects, suggested using machine learning.\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nThe goals of treatment for type 2 diabetes are to prevent or delay complications and maintain quality of life (Fig. [1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Fig1)).

The principles of how this can be achieved are summarised in Fig. [1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Fig1) and underpin the approach to management and care.

To identify newer evidence, a search was conducted on PubMed for randomised clinical trials (RCTs), systematic reviews and meta-analyses published in English between 1 January 2014 and 28 February 2018; eligible publications examined the effectiveness or safety of pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Reference lists were scanned in eligible reports to identify additional articles relevant to the subject. Details on the keywords and the search strategy are available at [https://doi.org/10.17632/h5rcnxpk8w.1](https://doi.org/10.17632/h5rcnxpk8w.1). Papers were grouped according to subject and the authors reviewed this new evidence to inform the consensus recommendations. The draft consensus recommendations were peer reviewed (see Acknowledgements), and suggestions incorporated as deemed appropriate by the authors. Nevertheless, though evidence based, the recommendations presented herein are the opinions of the authors.\\n\\n### The rationale, importance and context of glucose-lowering treatment\\n\\nLifestyle management, including medical nutrition therapy (MNT), physical activity, weight loss, counselling for smoking cessation, and psychological support, often delivered in the context of diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES), are fundamental aspects of diabetes care. The expanding number of glucose-lowering treatments—from behavioural interventions to medications and surgery—and growing information about their benefits and risks provides more options for people with diabetes and providers, but can complicate decision making. In this consensus statement, we attempt to provide an approach that summarises a large body of recent evidence for practitioners in the USA and Europe.\\n\\nMarked hyperglycaemia is associated with symptoms including frequent urination, thirst, blurred vision, fatigue and recurring infections. Beyond alleviating symptoms, the aim of blood glucose lowering (hereafter, referred to as glycaemic management) is to reduce long-term complications of diabetes. Good glycaemic management yields substantial and enduring reductions in onset and progression of microvascular complications. This benefit has been demonstrated most clearly early in the natural history of the disease in studies using metformin, sulfonylureas and insulin but is supported by more recent studies with other medication classes. The greatest absolute risk reduction (ARR) comes from improving poor glycaemic control, and a more modest reduction results from near normalisation of glycaemia \\\\[ [6](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR6)\\\\]. The impact of glucose control on macrovascular complications is less certain. Because the benefits of intensive glucose control emerge slowly, while the harms can be immediate, people with longer life expectancy have more to gain from intensive glucose control. A reasonable HbA1c target for most non-pregnant adults with sufficient life expectancy to see microvascular benefits (generally ~10 years) is around 53 mmol/mol (7%) or less \\\\[ [6](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR6)\\\\]. Glycaemic treatment targets should be individualised based on patient preferences and goals, risk of adverse effects of therapy (e.g. hypoglycaemia and weight gain) and patient characteristics, including frailty and comorbid conditions \\\\[ [2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR2)\\\\].\\n\\nAtherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of death in people with type 2 diabetes \\\\[ [7](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR7)\\\\]. Diabetes confers substantial independent ASCVD risk, and most people with type 2 diabetes have additional risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obesity, physical inactivity, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and smoking. Numerous studies have demonstrated the benefits of controlling modifiable ASCVD risk factors in people with diabetes. Substantial reductions in ASCVD events and death are seen when multiple ASCVD risk factors are addressed simultaneously, with long-standing benefits \\\\[ [8](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR8), [9](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR9)\\\\]. Comprehensive implementation of evidence-based interventions has likely contributed to the significant reductions in ASCVD events and mortality seen in people with diabetes in recent decades \\\\[ [10](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR10)\\\\]. ASCVD risk management in its many forms is an essential part of diabetes management that is beyond the scope of this statement, but physicians should be aware of the importance of multifactorial treatment in type 2 diabetes \\\\[ [7](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR7)\\\\].\\n\\n### Glucose management: monitoring\\n\\nGlycaemic management is primarily assessed with the HbA1c test, which was the measure studied in trials demonstrating the benefits of glucose lowering \\\\[ [2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR2)\\\\]. The performance of the test is generally excellent for National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP)-certified assays and laboratories ( [www.ngsp.org](http://www.ngsp.org)) \\\\[ [11](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR11)\\\\]. As with any laboratory test, HbA1c has limitations \\\\[ [2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR2)\\\\]. Because there is variability in the measurement of HbA1c, clinicians should exercise judgement, particularly when the result is close to the threshold that might prompt a change in therapy. HbA1c results may be discrepant from the patient’s true mean glycaemia in certain racial and ethnic groups, and in conditions that alter red blood cell turnover, such as anaemia, end-stage renal disease (ESRD; especially with erythropoietin therapy), and pregnancy, or if an HbA1c assay sensitive to haemoglobin variants is used in someone with sickle cell trait or other haemoglobinopathy. Discrepancies between measured HbA1c and measured or reported glucose levels should prompt consideration that one of these may not be reliable \\\\[ [12](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR12)\\\\].\\n\\nRegular self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) may help with self-management and medication adjustment, particularly in individuals taking insulin. SMBG plans should be individualised. People with diabetes and the healthcare team should use the data in an effective and timely manner. In people with type 2 diabetes not using insulin, routine glucose monitoring is of limited additional clinical benefit while adding burden and cost \\\\[ [13](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR13), [14](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR14)\\\\]. However, for some individuals, glucose monitoring can provide insight into the impact of lifestyle and medication management on blood glucose and symptoms, particularly when combined with education and support. Novel technologies, such as continuous or flash glucose monitoring, provide more information. However, in type 2 diabetes, they have been associated with only modest benefits \\\\[ [15](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR15)\\\\].\\n\\n### Principles of care\\n\\nProviding patient-centred care that acknowledges multi-morbidity, and is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences and barriers, including the differential costs of therapies, is essential to effective diabetes management \\\\[ [16](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR16)\\\\]. Shared decision making, facilitated by decision aids that show the absolute benefit and risk of alternative treatment options, is a useful strategy to arrive at the best treatment course for an individual \\\\[ [17](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR17), [18](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR18), [19](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR19), [20](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR20)\\\\]. Providers should evaluate the impact of any suggested intervention, including self-care regimens, in the context of cognitive impairment, limited literacy, distinct cultural beliefs and individual fears or health concerns given their impact on treatment efficacy.\\n\\n### DSMES\\n\\nDSMES is a key intervention to enable people with diabetes to make informed decisions and to assume responsibility for day-to-day diabetes management. DSMES is central to establishing and implementing the principles of care (Fig. [1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Fig1)). DSMES programmes usually involve face-to-face contact in group or individual sessions with trained educators, and key components are shown in the Table [1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Tab1) \\\\[ [21](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR21), [22](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR22), [23](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR23), [24](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR24), [25](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR25)\\\\]. While DSMES should be available on an ongoing basis, critical junctures when DSMES should occur include at diagnosis, annually, when complications arise and during transitions in life and care \\\\[ [22](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR22)\\\\].\\n\\n**Table 1 Key components of DSMES \\\\[ [21](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR21), [23](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR23), [24](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR24), [25](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR25)\\\\]**\\n\\n[Full size table](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5/tables/1)\\n\\nDSMES programmes delivered from diagnosis can promote medication adherence, healthy eating and physical activity, and increase self-efficacy. In type 2 diabetes, high-quality evidence has consistently shown that DSMES is a cost-effective intervention in the healthcare systems studied. DSMES significantly improves clinical and psychological outcomes, improves glycaemic control, reduces hospital admissions, improves patient knowledge, and reduces the risk of all-cause mortality \\\\[ [22](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR22), [26](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR26), [27](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR27), [28](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR28), [29](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR29), [30](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR30), [31](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR31)\\\\]. The best outcomes are achieved in those programmes with a theory-based and structured curriculum, and with contact time of over 10 h. While online programmes may reinforce learning, there is little evidence they are effective when used alone \\\\[ [27](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR27)\\\\].\\n\\nSuboptimal adherence, including poor persistence, to therapy affects almost half of people with diabetes, leading to suboptimal glycaemic and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor control as well as increased risk of diabetes complications, mortality, hospital admissions and healthcare costs \\\\[ [32](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR32), [33](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR33), [34](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR34), [35](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR35), [36](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR36)\\\\]. Though this consensus recommendation focuses on medication adherence (including persistence), the principles are pertinent to all aspects of diabetes care. Multiple factors contribute to inconsistent medication use and treatment discontinuation, including patient-perceived lack of medication efficacy, fear of hypoglycaemia, lack of access to medication and adverse effects of medication \\\\[ [37](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR37)\\\\]. Medication adherence (including persistence) varies across medication classes and careful consideration of these differences may help improve outcomes \\\\[ [38](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR38)\\\\]. Ultimately, patient preference is a major factor driving the choice of medication. Even in cases where clinical characteristics suggest the use of a particular medication based on the available evidence from clinical trials, patient preferences regarding route of administration, injection devices, side effects or cost may prevent their use by some individuals \\\\[ [39](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR39)\\\\].\\n\\nTherapeutic inertia, sometimes referred to as clinical inertia, refers to failure to intensify therapy when treatment targets are not met. The causes of therapeutic inertia are multifactorial, occurring at the level of the practitioner, patient and/or healthcare system \\\\[ [40](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR40)\\\\]. Interventions targeting therapeutic inertia have facilitated improved glycaemic control and timely insulin intensification \\\\[ [41](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR41), [42](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR42)\\\\]. For example, multidisciplinary teams that include nurse practitioners or pharmacists may help reduce therapeutic inertia \\\\[ [43](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR43), [44](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR44)\\\\]. A fragmented healthcare system may contribute to therapeutic inertia and impair delivery of patient-centred care. A coordinated chronic care model, including self-management support, decision support, delivery system design, clinical information systems, and community resources and policies, promotes interaction between more empowered patients and better prepared and proactive healthcare teams \\\\[ [45](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR45)\\\\].\\n\\n## Recommended process for glucose-lowering medication selection: where does new evidence from cardiovascular outcomes trials fit in?\\n\\nIn prior consensus statements, efficacy in reducing hyperglycaemia, along with tolerability and safety were primary factors in glucose-lowering medication selection. Patient preferences, glycaemic targets, comorbidities, polypharmacy, side effects and cost were additional important considerations. For every individual, the choice of glucose-lowering medication should be underpinned by lifestyle management, DSMES and the patient-centred care principles outlined in Fig. [1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Fig1).\\n\\nFigure [2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Fig2) describes our new consensus approach to glucose lowering with medications in type 2 diabetes. Because of the new evidence for the benefit of specific medications to reduce mortality, heart failure (HF) and progression of renal disease _in the setting of established_ CVD _,_ their use was considered compelling in this patient group. Thus, we recommend that providers consider a history of CVD very early in the process of treatment selection. Other factors affect the choice of glucose-lowering medications, particularly in the setting of patient-centred care. In addition to CVD, we recommend early consideration of weight, hypoglycaemic risk, treatment cost and other patient-related factors that may influence treatment selection (Figs [2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Fig2), [3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Fig3), [4](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Fig4), [5](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Fig5), [6](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Fig6)).\\n\\n**Fig. 2**\\n\\nGlucose-lowering medication in type 2 diabetes: overall approach\\n\\n[Full size image](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5/figures/2)\\n\\n**Fig. 3**\\n\\nChoosing glucose-lowering medication in those with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or chronic kidney disease (CKD)\\n\\n[Full size image](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5/figures/3)\\n\\n**Fig. 4**\\n\\nChoosing glucose-lowering medication if compelling need to minimise weight gain or promote weight loss\\n\\n[Full size image](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5/figures/4)\\n\\n**Fig. 5**\\n\\nChoosing glucose-lowering medication if compelling need to minimise hypoglycaemia\\n\\n[Full size image](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5/figures/5)\\n\\n**Fig. 6**\\n\\nChoosing glucose-lowering medication if cost is a major issue\\n\\n[Full size image](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5/figures/6)\\n\\n### Implications of new evidence from cardiovascular outcomes trials\\n\\nThe major change from prior consensus reports is based on new evidence that specific sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors or glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists improve cardiovascular outcomes, as well as secondary outcomes such as HF and progression of renal disease, in patients with established CVD or CKD. Therefore, an important early step in this new approach (Fig. [3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Fig3)) is to consider the presence or absence of ASCVD, HF and CKD, conditions in aggregate affecting 15–25% of the population with type 2 diabetes. While the new evidence supporting the use of particular medications in patients who also have established CVD or are at high risk of CVD is derived from large cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs) demonstrating substantial benefits over 2–5 years, it is important to remember that each trial constitutes a single experiment. Within each drug class, results have been heterogeneous. It is not clear whether there are true drug class effects with different findings for individual medications due to differences in trial design and conduct, or whether there are real differences between medications within a drug class due to properties of the individual compounds. Where the current evidence is strongest for a specific medication within a class, it is noted. The ADA’s ‘Standards of medical care in diabetes’ will align with this document and will be updated to reflect new evidence as it emerges from ongoing clinical trials.\\n\\nASCVD is defined somewhat differently across trials, but all trials enrolled individuals with established CVD (e.g. myocardial infarction \\\\[MI\\\\], stroke, any revascularisation procedure) while variably including related conditions compatible with clinically significant atherosclerosis (e.g. transient ischaemic attack, hospitalised unstable angina, amputation, congestive heart failure New York Heart Association \\\\[NYHA\\\\] class II–III, >50% stenosis of any artery, symptomatic or asymptomatic coronary artery disease documented by imaging, CKD with estimated GFR \\\\[eGFR\\\\] <60 ml min-1 \\\\[1.73 m\\\\]-2). Most trials also included a ‘risk factor only’ group with entry criteria based on age and usually the presence of two or more cardiac risk factors \\\\[ [46](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR46)\\\\]. Trials were designed to evaluate cardiovascular safety (i.e. statistical non-inferiority compared with placebo), but several showed ASCVD outcome benefit (i.e. statistical superiority compared with placebo), including, in some cases, mortality.\\n\\nAmong GLP-1 receptor agonists, liraglutide, studied in the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcomes Results (LEADER) trial ( _n_ = 9340) demonstrated an ARR of 1.9% with an HR of 0.87 (95% CI 0.78, 0.97; _p_ = 0.01 for superiority) for the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke (major adverse cardiac events \\\\[MACE\\\\]) compared with placebo over 3.8 years. Each component of the composite contributed to the benefit, and the HR for cardiovascular death was 0.78 (95% CI 0.66, 0.93; _p_ = 0.007; ARR 1.7%). The LEADER trial also demonstrated an HR of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.74 to 0.97; _p_ = 0.02; ARR 1.4%) for all-cause mortality \\\\[ [47](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR47)\\\\]. In the Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long-term Outcomes with Semaglutide in Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN 6) ( _n_ = 3297), semaglutide compared with placebo demonstrated an ARR of 2.3% with HR 0.74 for MACE (95% CI 0.58, 0.95; _p_ = 0.02 for superiority) over 2.1 years, but the reduction in events appeared to be driven by the rate of stroke, rather than CVD death \\\\[ [48](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR48)\\\\]. The Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL) compared exenatide extended-release with placebo over 3.2 years in 14,752 participants with type 2 diabetes. While the medication was safe (non-inferior), the HR for MACE in the entire trial was 0.91 (95% CI 0.83, 1.0; _p_ = 0.06) not reaching the threshold for demonstrated superiority vs placebo; ARR was 0.8% \\\\[ [49](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR49)\\\\]. All-cause death was lower in the exenatide arm (ARR 1%, HR 0.86 \\\\[95% CI 0.77, 0.97\\\\]), but it was not considered to be statistically significant in the hierarchical testing procedure applied. Lixisenatide, a short-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist, did not demonstrate CVD benefit or harm in a trial of patients recruited within 180 days of an acute coronary syndrome admission \\\\[ [50](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR50)\\\\]. Taken together, it appears that among patients _with established CVD_, some GLP-1 receptor agonists may provide cardiovascular benefit, with the evidence of benefit strongest for liraglutide, favourable for semaglutide, and less certain for exenatide. There is no evidence of cardiovascular benefit with lixisenatide. Adverse effects for the class are discussed in the section ‘ [The full range of therapeutic options: lifestyle management, medication and obesity management](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Sec9)’.\\n\\nAmong the SGLT2 inhibitors, empagliflozin compared with placebo was studied in the Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) in 7020 participants with type 2 diabetes and CVD. With a median follow-up of 3.1 years, the ARR was 1.6% and the HR was 0.86 (95% CI 0.74, 0.99; _p_ = 0.04 for superiority) for the primary composite endpoint of non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke and cardiovascular death. The ARR was 2.2% and the HR was 0.62 (95% CI 0.49, 0.77; _p_ < 0.001) for cardiovascular death \\\\[ [51](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR51)\\\\]. The ARR was 2.6% and the HR was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.57, 0.82; _p_ < 0.001) for death from any cause. Canagliflozin compared with placebo was studied in the Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) Program (comprised of two similar trials, CANVAS and CANVAS-Renal; _n_ = 10,142) in participants with type 2 diabetes, 66% of whom had a history of CVD. Participants were followed for a median of 3.6 years. In the combined analysis of the two trials, the primary composite endpoint of MI, stroke or cardiovascular death was reduced with canagliflozin (26.9 vs 31.5 participants per patient-year with placebo; HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75, 0.97; _p_ = 0.02) for superiority in the pooled analysis, with consistent findings in the component studies. Though there was a trend towards benefit for cardiovascular death, the difference from placebo was not statistically significant in the CANVAS Program \\\\[ [52](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR52)\\\\]. For the SGLT2 inhibitors studied to date, it appears that among patients _with established CVD_, there is likely cardiovascular benefit, with the evidence of benefit modestly stronger for empagliflozin than canagliflozin. Adverse effects for the class are discussed in the section ‘ [The full range of therapeutic options: lifestyle management, medication and obesity management](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Sec9)’.\\n\\nWhile the evidence of an ASCVD outcomes benefit for GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors has been demonstrated for people with established ASCVD, the evidence of benefit beyond glucose lowering has not been demonstrated in those without ASCVD. Indeed, in subgroup analyses of these trials, lower risk individuals have not been observed to have an ASCVD benefit. While this may be due to the short time frame of the studies and the low event rate in those without ASCVD, the finding is consistent across the reported trials. Overall, CVOTs of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors have demonstrated safety, i.e. non-inferiority relative to placebo, for the primary MACE endpoint, but not cardiovascular benefit.\\n\\nThe available evidence for cardiovascular event reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes and clinical CVD is derived from trials in which the participants were not meeting glycaemic targets (HbA1c ≥53 mmol/mol \\\\[≥7%\\\\] at baseline). Furthermore, most (~70% across trials) participants were treated with metformin at baseline. Thus, we recommend that patients with clinical CVD not meeting individualised glycaemic targets while treated with metformin (or in whom metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated) should have an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist with proven benefit for cardiovascular risk reduction added to their treatment programme. There are no clinical trial data that support prescribing an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist with the intent of reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with an HbA1c <53 mmol/mol (<7%). Limited data suggest that there is no heterogeneity in the cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists as a function of background glucose-lowering therapy. Thus, background glucose-lowering therapy in patients with clinical CVD arguably is not pertinent in clinical decision making. However, dose adjustment or discontinuation of background medications may be required to avoid hypoglycaemia when adding a new agent to a regimen containing insulin, sulfonylurea or glinide therapy, particularly in patients at or near glycaemic goals. Full efforts to achieve glycaemic and blood pressure targets and to adhere to lipid, antiplatelet, antithrombotic and tobacco cessation guidelines \\\\[ [7](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR7)\\\\] should continue after an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist is added, as such efforts were integral to all studies that have demonstrated cardiovascular benefit of these agents.\\n\\nPatients with type 2 diabetes are at increased risk of HF \\\\[ [53](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR53)\\\\]. In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME and CANVAS CVOT studies testing SGLT2 inhibitors, which enrolled participants with ASCVD, >85% of participants did not have symptomatic HF at baseline. Yet, in both trials there was a clinically and statistically significant reduction in hospitalisation for HF for the SGLT2 inhibitor as compared with placebo. In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study with empagliflozin \\\\[ [54](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR54)\\\\], the ARR was 1.4%, and the HR 0.65 (95% CI 0.50, 0.85) and in the CANVAS Program with canagliflozin the HR was 0.67 (95% CI 0.52, 0.87), with a rate of hospitalised HF of 5.5 vs 8.7 events per 1000 patient-years \\\\[ [55](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR55)\\\\]. Because HF was neither well characterised at baseline nor as carefully adjudicated as it would have been in a trial specifically designed to evaluate HF outcomes, and because HF was a secondary endpoint in the trials, further ongoing studies are required to conclusively address the issue. That said, the significant reduction in hospitalisation for HF demonstrated in the two study populations and the consistency across two independent trial programmes suggest to us that treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors in the setting of clinical HF may provide substantial benefit and should be specifically considered in people with type 2 diabetes and ASCVD and HF.\\n\\nIn the GLP-1 receptor agonist studies LEADER, SUSTAIN 6 and EXSCEL, there was no significant effect on hospitalization for HF with HR 0.86 (95% CI 0.71, 1.06), 1.11 (95% CI 0.77, 1.61) and 0.94 (95% CI 0.78, 1.13), respectively \\\\[ [47](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR47), [48](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR48), [49](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR49)\\\\]. Two short-term studies of liraglutide in patients with reduced ejection fraction suggested a lack of benefit in this setting \\\\[ [56](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR56), [57](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR57)\\\\].\\n\\nAmong the recent cardiovascular safety outcomes trials testing DPP-4 inhibitors, the Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascular Outcomes Recorded in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus – Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 53 (SAVOR-TIMI 53) study evaluating saxagliptin demonstrated a significant increased risk of HF, with 3.5% risk of hospitalisation for HF vs 2.8% for placebo (HR 1.27; 95% CI 1.07, 1.51; _p_ = 0.007) \\\\[ [58](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR58)\\\\]. In the subsequent Examination of Cardiovascular Outcomes with Alogliptin versus Standard of Care (EXAMINE) study of alogliptin there was no statistically significant difference in HF hospitalisation (3.9% vs 3.3% with placebo) \\\\[ [59](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR59)\\\\], and in the Trial Evaluating Cardiovascular Outcomes with Sitagliptin (TECOS), the rate of hospitalisation for HF was 3.1% in both sitagliptin- and placebo-treated patients \\\\[ [60](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR60)\\\\].\\n\\nPatients with type 2 diabetes and kidney disease are at an increased risk for cardiovascular events. A substantial number of participants with an eGFR of 30–60 ml min−1 \\\\[1.73 m\\\\]−2 were included in EMPA-REG OUTCOME, CANVAS, LEADER and SUSTAIN 6. An important finding in the studies was reduction of the primary ASCVD outcome even among participants with stage 3 CKD (eGFR 30–60 ml min−1 \\\\[1.73 m\\\\]−2). For SGLT2 inhibitors, this contrasts with the glucose-lowering effect, which diminishes with declining eGFR.\\n\\nIn addition to the primary cardiovascular endpoints, most of the SGLT2 inhibitor and GLP-1 receptor agonist CVOTs reported benefit in renal endpoints, albeit as secondary outcomes. The renal outcome benefit has been most pronounced and consistent for SGLT2 inhibitors. EMPA-REG OUTCOME (empagliflozin) demonstrated an ARR 6.1%, HR of 0.61 (95% CI 0.53, 0.70) for the composite outcome of new or worsening nephropathy (progression to urine albumin/creatinine ratio >33.9 mg/mmol (>300 mg/g), doubling of serum creatinine and ESRD, or death by ESRD). The most prevalent outcome component was the development of sustained albuminuria, but the other components were each significantly reduced relative to placebo \\\\[ [61](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR61)\\\\]. CANVAS (canagliflozin) reported an HR of 1.7 (95% CI 1.51, 1.91) for regression of albuminuria and a 40% reduction in risk in the composite outcome of eGFR, ESRD or renal death (5.5 vs 9.0 participants per 1000 patient-years; HR 0.60; 95% CI 0.47, 0.77) \\\\[ [52](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR52)\\\\]. Additional trials with primary renal endpoints are ongoing in high-risk renal populations. The Canagliflozin and Renal Endpoints in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial examining canagliflozin in CKD with proteinuria has been stopped at a planned interim analysis for achieving the primary efficacy endpoint \\\\[ [62](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR62)\\\\].\\n\\nIn LEADER and SUSTAIN 6, the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide was associated with an ARR of 1.5% and an HR of 0.78 (95% CI 0.67, 0.92) for new or worsening nephropathy \\\\[ [63](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR63)\\\\], and semaglutide demonstrated an ARR of 2.3% and an HR of 0.64 (95% CI 0.46, 0.88) for new or worsening nephropathy \\\\[ [48](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR48)\\\\]. Progression of albuminuria was the most prevalent component of the composite renal endpoint, whereas the other components (doubling of serum creatinine, ESRD or renal death) did not contribute substantially to the benefit. In the DPP-4 inhibitor CVOTs, the DPP-4 inhibitors have been shown to be safe from a renal perspective, with modest reduction in albuminuria \\\\[ [64](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR64)\\\\].\\n\\n## The full range of therapeutic options: lifestyle management, medication and obesity management\\n\\nThis section summarises the lifestyle, medication and obesity management therapies that lower glucose or improve other outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. A more comprehensive discussion of these issues is available elsewhere \\\\[ [3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR3), [21](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR21), [65](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR65)\\\\]. For more details on weight loss medications and metabolic surgery, see the section ‘ [Obesity management beyond lifestyle intervention](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Sec22)’. Basic information about specific options in each category of therapy is summarised in Table [2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Tab2).\\n\\n**Table 2 Glucose-lowering medications and therapies available in the USA or Europe and specific characteristics that may guide individualised treatment choices in non-pregnant adults with type 2 diabetes**\\n\\n[Full size table](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5/tables/2)\\n\\nLifestyle interventions, including MNT and physical activity, are effective and safe for improving glucose control in type 2 diabetes. For these reasons, they are recommended as first-line therapies from the time of diagnosis and as co-therapy for patients who also require glucose-lowering medications or metabolic surgery. Lifestyle management should be part of the ongoing discussion with individuals with type 2 diabetes at each visit.\\n\\n### Lifestyle management\\n\\n#### Medical nutrition therapy\\n\\nMNT comprises education and support to help patients adopt healthy eating patterns. The goal of MNT is to manage blood glucose and cardiovascular risk factors to reduce risk for diabetes-related complications while preserving the pleasure of eating \\\\[ [21](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR21)\\\\]. Two basic dimensions of MNT include dietary quality and energy restriction. Strategies directed at each dimension can improve glycaemic control.\\n\\n### Dietary quality and eating patterns\\n\\nThere is no single ratio of carbohydrate, proteins and fat intake that is optimal for every person with type 2 diabetes. Instead, there are many good options and professional guidelines usually recommend individually selected eating patterns that emphasise foods of demonstrated health benefit, that minimise foods of demonstrated harm and that accommodate patient preference and metabolic needs, with the goal of identifying healthy dietary habits that are feasible and sustainable. Three trials of a Mediterranean eating pattern reported modest weight loss and improved glycaemic control \\\\[ [66](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR66), [67](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR67), [68](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR68)\\\\]. In one of these, people with new-onset diabetes assigned to a low-carbohydrate Mediterranean eating pattern were 37% less likely to require glucose-lowering medications over 4 years compared with patients assigned to a low-fat diet (HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.51, 0.86). A meta-analysis of RCTs in patients with type 2 diabetes showed that the Mediterranean eating pattern reduced HbA1c more than control diets (mean difference −3.3 mmol/mol, 95% CI −5.1, −1.5 mmol/mol \\\\[−0.30%, 95% CI −0.46%, −0.14%\\\\]) \\\\[ [69](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR69)\\\\]. Low-carbohydrate, low-glycaemic index and high-protein diets, and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet all improve glycaemic control, but the effect of the Mediterranean eating pattern appears to be the greatest \\\\[ [70](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR70), [71](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR71), [72](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR72)\\\\]. Low-carbohydrate diets (<26% of total energy) produce substantial reductions in HbA1c at 3 months (−5.2 mmol/mol, 95% CI −7.8, −2.5 mmol/mol \\\\[−0.47%, 95% CI −0.71%, −0.23%\\\\]) and 6 months (4.0 mmol/mol, 95% CI −6.8, −1.0 mmol/mol \\\\[−0.36%, 95% CI −0.62%, −0.09%\\\\]), with diminishing effects at 12 and 24 months; no benefit of moderate carbohydrate restriction (26–45%) was observed \\\\[ [73](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR73)\\\\]. Vegetarian eating patterns have been shown to lower HbA1c, but not fasting glucose, compared with non-vegetarian ones \\\\[ [74](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR74)\\\\]. Very recent trials of different eating patterns in type 2 diabetes have typically also included weight reduction, hindering firm conclusions regarding the distinct contribution of dietary quality.\\n\\n### Non-surgical energy restriction for weight loss\\n\\nIf a patient wishes to aim for remission of type 2 diabetes, particularly within 6 years of diagnosis, evidence-based weight management programmes are often successful.\\n\\nThe most effective non-surgical strategies for weight reduction involve food substitution and intensive, sustained counselling (e.g. 12–26 individual counselling sessions over 6–12 months). Among adults with type 2 diabetes, meal replacement (825–853 kcal/day \\\\[3450–3570 kj/day\\\\] formula-diet for 3–5 months) followed by gradual reintroduction of food and intensive counselling resulted in 9 kg placebo-adjusted weight loss at 1 year and high rates of diabetes remission (46% vs 4%; OR 19.7; 95% CI 7.8, 49.8) compared with best usual practice \\\\[ [75](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR75)\\\\]. In terms of intensive behavioural interventions, the Action for Health in Diabetes (Look AHEAD) trial \\\\[ [76](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR76)\\\\] randomised 5145 overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes to an intensive lifestyle programme that promoted energy restriction, incorporating meal replacements to induce and sustain weight loss, along with increased physical activity compared with standard diabetes education and support in the control group. After 9.6 years, weight loss was greater in the intervention group (8.6% vs 0.7% at 1 year; 6.0% vs 3.5% at study end; both _p_ < 0.05). HbA1c also fell in the intervention group despite less use of glucose-lowering medications. Cardiovascular event rates were not reduced but there were numerous other benefits. In a 12 month trial, 563 adults with type 2 diabetes who were randomised to Weight Watchers compared with standard care had a 2.1% net weight loss (−4.0% vs −1.9%; _p_ < 0.001), a 5.3 mmol/mol (−3.5 vs +1.8 mmol/mol; _p_ = 0.020) net absolute improvement in HbA1c (0.48% \\\\[−0.32% vs +0.16%\\\\]), and a greater reduction in use of glucose-lowering medications (−26% vs +12%; _p_ < 0.001) \\\\[ [77](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR77)\\\\]. Similar programmes have resulted in a net 3 kg weight loss over 12–18 months \\\\[ [78](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR78), [79](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR79), [80](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR80)\\\\].\\n\\n#### Physical activity\\n\\nAerobic exercise, resistance training, and the combination of the two are effective in reducing HbA1c by about 6.6 mmol/mol (0.6%) \\\\[ [81](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR81), [82](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR82), [83](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR83), [84](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR84)\\\\]. Of these modalities, some evidence suggests that aerobic exercise and the combination of aerobic exercise and resistance training may be more effective than resistance training alone \\\\[ [85](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR85)\\\\], but this remains controversial. When considering exercise interventions, special considerations are required for individuals with CVD, uncontrolled retinopathy or nephropathy and severe neuropathy. A wide range of physical activity, including leisure time activities (e.g. walking, swimming, gardening, jogging, tai chi and yoga) can significantly reduce HbA1c \\\\[ [86](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR86), [87](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR87), [88](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR88), [89](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR89), [90](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR90)\\\\]. In general, supervision of exercise and motivational strategies, such as monitoring using a step counter, can improve the effect of exercise on HbA1c compared with advice alone \\\\[ [84](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR84), [91](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR91)\\\\]. The combination of dietary change for weight reduction and physical exercise improves hyperglycaemia and reduces cardiovascular risk factors more than dietary interventions or physical activity alone \\\\[ [92](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR92)\\\\].\\n\\n### Medications for lowering glucose\\n\\n#### Metformin\\n\\nMetformin is an oral medication that reduces plasma glucose via multiple mechanisms. It is available as an immediate-release formulation that is typically administered twice a day and as extended-release formulations for once-daily or twice-daily administration. The formulations are equally effective with no consistent differences in side effect profile \\\\[ [93](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR93)\\\\]. Dosages of immediate-release metformin start at 500 mg once or twice a day with meals, and should be increased as tolerated to a target dosage of 1000 mg twice a day. The maximum daily dose is 2550 mg in the USA and 3000 mg in the European Union, though doses above 2000 mg are generally associated with little additional efficacy and poorer tolerability \\\\[ [94](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR94)\\\\]. Gastrointestinal symptoms are common and dose-dependent, and may improve over time or with dose reduction. Metformin should not be used in patients with an eGFR <30 ml min−1 \\\\[1.73 m\\\\]−2 and dose reduction should be considered when the eGFR is <45 ml min−1 \\\\[1.73 m\\\\]−2 \\\\[ [95](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR95), [96](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR96), [97](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR97)\\\\]. Caution should be taken when conditions are present that may reduce eGFR. Advantages of metformin include its high efficacy, low cost, minimal hypoglycaemia risk when used as monotherapy, and the potential for some weight loss. Some studies have suggested a benefit for preventing CVD \\\\[ [98](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR98)\\\\], but this has not been supported by the results of a recent meta-analysis \\\\[ [99](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR99)\\\\]. However, metformin may lower risk for cardiovascular mortality compared with sulfonylurea therapy \\\\[ [100](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR100)\\\\]. Rare cases of lactic acidosis have been reported, usually in the setting of severe illness or acute kidney injury. Therefore, metformin should be omitted in the setting of severe illness, vomiting or dehydration. Metformin may result in lower serum vitamin B12 concentration; therefore, periodic monitoring and supplementation is generally recommended if levels are deficient, particularly in those with anaemia or neuropathy \\\\[ [101](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR101)\\\\]. Because of its high efficacy in lowering HbA1c, good safety profile and low cost, metformin remains the first-line medication for management of type 2 diabetes.\\n\\n#### SGLT2 inhibitors\\n\\nSGLT2 inhibitors are oral medications that reduce plasma glucose by enhancing urinary excretion of glucose \\\\[ [102](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR102)\\\\]. The glucose-lowering efficacy of these medications is dependent on renal function. Initiation and continuation of SGLT2 inhibitors are restricted by eGFR and require intermittent monitoring of renal function (refer to European Medicines Agency and US Food and Drug Administration prescribing information for current recommendations). These medications are of high efficacy in lowering glucose in the setting of normal renal function \\\\[ [51](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR51), [52](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR52), [103](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR103)\\\\]. All SGLT2 inhibitors are associated with a reduction in weight and blood pressure. Alone or with metformin, they do not increase the risk for hypoglycaemia. Empagliflozin and canagliflozin have cardiac and renal benefits in patients with established or at high risk of ASCVD. Cardiac and renal benefits have been demonstrated down to an eGFR of 30 ml min−1 \\\\[1.73 m\\\\]−2, though currently none of the SGLT2 inhibitors have been approved for use by regulators at an eGFR below 45 ml min−1 \\\\[1.73 m\\\\]−2 (see the section ‘ [Recommended process for glucose-lowering medication selection: where does new evidence from cardiovascular outcomes trials fit in?](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Sec7)’) \\\\[ [51](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR51), [52](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR52), [61](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR61)\\\\]. The class is associated with increased risk for mycotic genital infections (mostly vaginitis in women, balanitis in men) \\\\[ [51](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR51), [52](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR52), [104](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR104), [105](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR105)\\\\]. Case reports of diabetic ketoacidosis with SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes continue to raise concern, though increased rates have not been confirmed in large trials \\\\[ [102](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR102), [106](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR106)\\\\]. Therefore, the SGLT2 inhibitors should be used with caution and appropriate patient education should be provided for those with insulin deficiency. SGLT2 inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury, dehydration and orthostatic hypotension; caution should be taken when SGLT2 inhibitors are used in combination with diuretics and/or ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. Canagliflozin has been associated with increased risk for lower limb amputation (6.3 canagliflozin vs 3.4 per 1000 patient-years with placebo after 3.1 years; HR 1.97; 95% CI 1.41, 2.75;) \\\\[ [52](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR52)\\\\]. Similarly, fracture risk has been reported with canagliflozin (15.4 vs 11.9 participants with fracture per 1000 patient-years; HR 1.26; 95% CI 1.04, 1.52) \\\\[ [52](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR52)\\\\]. It is uncertain whether amputation and fractures are class effects.\\n\\n#### GLP-1 receptor agonists\\n\\nGLP-1 receptor agonists are currently delivered by subcutaneous injection. These medications stimulate insulin secretion and reduce glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner, improve satiety and promote weight loss \\\\[ [107](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR107), [108](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR108)\\\\]. Structural differences among GLP-1 receptor agonists affect duration of action, and their formulation and dosing may affect efficacy for glucose-lowering and weight reduction as well as side effect profile and cardiovascular effects \\\\[ [109](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR109)\\\\]. Dulaglutide, exenatide extended-release and semaglutide are administered once weekly \\\\[ [108](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR108), [109](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR109)\\\\]. Liraglutide and lixisenatide are administered once daily, and exenatide is available in a twice-daily formulation.

Evidence suggests that the effect may be greatest for semaglutide once weekly, followed by dulaglutide and liraglutide, closely followed by exenatide once weekly, and then exenatide twice daily and lixisenatide \\\\[ [110](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR110), [112](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR112), [113](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR113), [114](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR114), [115](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR115), [116](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR116)\\\\]. The short-acting medications exenatide twice daily and lixisenatide have greater postprandial effects, at least after the meals with which they are administered. All GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce weight \\\\[ [110](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR110)\\\\]; the reduction ranges from about 1.5 kg to 6.0 kg over about 30 weeks of therapy \\\\[ [110](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR110), [117](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR117)\\\\]. Liraglutide and semaglutide have been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes \\\\[ [47](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR47), [48](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR48)\\\\] (see the section ‘ [Recommended process for glucose-lowering medication selection: where does new evidence from cardiovascular outcomes trials fit in?](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Sec7)’). The most common side effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists are nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, though these tend to diminish over time. GLP-1 receptor agonists have minimal risk for hypoglycaemia, but may increase the hypoglycaemic potential of insulin and sulfonylureas when combined with those medications \\\\[ [118](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR118)\\\\]. Contrary to early signals, GLP-1 receptor agonists do not seem to substantially increase risk for pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer or bone disease \\\\[ [119](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR119)\\\\]. They are associated with increased risk of gallbladder events \\\\[ [120](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR120)\\\\]. Semaglutide was associated with increased retinopathy complications in the SUSTAIN 6 trial (HR 1.76, 95% CI 1.11, 2.78), largely among those with baseline retinopathy who had rapid improvement of glycaemic control \\\\[ [48](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR48)\\\\]. While this observation remains unexplained, this is also a recognised effect of intensification of glycaemic control with insulin.\\n\\n#### DPP-4 inhibitors\\n\\nDPP-4 inhibitors are oral medications that increase insulin secretion and reduce glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. They have moderate glucose-lowering efficacy \\\\[ [121](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR121), [122](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR122)\\\\]. DPP-4 inhibitors are well tolerated, have a neutral effect on weight and have minimal risk of hypoglycaemia when used as monotherapy \\\\[ [123](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR123)\\\\]. When added to sulfonylurea therapy, however, the risk for hypoglycaemia is increased 50% compared with sulfonylurea therapy alone \\\\[ [124](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR124)\\\\]. The recommended dose for each DPP-4 inhibitor is determined and needs to be adjusted based on renal function; linagliptin is the exception as it has minimal renal excretion. Rare but increased rates of pancreatitis \\\\[ [125](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR125)\\\\] and musculoskeletal side effects have been reported \\\\[ [126](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR126)\\\\].

Lower dose therapy (e.g. pioglitazone 15–30 mg) mitigates weight gain and oedema, but the broader benefits and harms of low-dose TZD therapy have not been evaluated.\\n\\n#### Sulfonylureas\\n\\nSulfonylureas are oral medications that lower glucose by stimulating insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. They are inexpensive, widely available, and have high glucose-lowering efficacy \\\\[ [146](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR146)\\\\]. Sulfonylureas were used as part of the glucose-lowering regimen in the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) \\\\[ [147](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR147)\\\\] and Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) \\\\[ [148](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR148)\\\\] trials, which both demonstrated reductions in microvascular complications. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain and risk for hypoglycaemia and down titration of dose to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia results in higher HbA1c \\\\[ [146](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR146), [149](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR149), [150](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR150)\\\\]. Sulfonylureas are known to be associated with a lack of durable effect on glucose lowering \\\\[ [144](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR144), [151](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR151)\\\\]. The weight gain associated with sulfonylureas is relatively modest in large cohort studies and the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia is lower than with insulin \\\\[ [152](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR152)\\\\]. Important differences among sulfonylureas affect both safety and efficacy. Glibenclamide (known as glyburide in the USA and Canada) has a higher risk of hypoglycaemia compared with other sulfonylureas \\\\[ [153](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR153)\\\\]. Glipizide, glimepiride and gliclazide may have a lower risk for hypoglycaemia compared with other sulfonylureas \\\\[ [152](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR152), [154](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR154)\\\\]. Adverse cardiovascular outcomes with sulfonylureas in some observational studies have raised concerns, although findings from recent systematic reviews have found no increase in all-cause mortality compared with other active treatments \\\\[ [152](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR152)\\\\]. As newer-generation sulfonylureas appear to confer a lower risk of hypoglycaemia and have favourable cost, efficacy and safety profiles, sulfonylureas remain a reasonable choice among glucose-lowering medications, particularly when cost is an important consideration. Patient education and use of low or variable dosing with later-generation sulfonylureas may be used to mitigate the risk of hypoglycaemia. Greatest caution in this regard is warranted for people at high risk of hypoglycaemia, such as older patients and those with CKD.\\n\\n#### Insulin\\n\\nNumerous formulations of insulin are available with differing durations of action. ‘Human’ insulins (NPH, regular \\\\[R\\\\], and premixed combinations of NPH and R) are recombinant DNA-derived human insulin, while insulin analogues have been designed to change the onset or duration of action. The main advantage of insulin over other glucose-lowering medications is that insulin lowers glucose in a dose-dependent manner over a wide range, to almost any glycaemic target as limited by hypoglycaemia. Older formulations of insulin have also demonstrated reduction in microvascular complications and with long-term follow-up, all-cause mortality and diabetes-related death \\\\[ [147](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR147), [155](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR155)\\\\]. Beyond hypoglycaemia, the disadvantages of insulin include weight gain and the need for injection, frequent titration for optimal efficacy and glucose monitoring \\\\[ [156](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR156)\\\\].\\n\\nThe effectiveness of insulin is highly dependent on its appropriate use; patient selection and training; adjustment of dose for changes in diet, activity or weight; and titration to acceptable, safe glucose targets. Formulations of intermediate- and long-acting insulin have different timings of onset, durations of action and risks of hypoglycaemia. However, the way in which insulin is administered, including the dose, timing of injection and glycaemic targets, has a greater impact on the adverse effects of insulin than differences among insulin formulations.\\n\\n### Basal insulin\\n\\nBasal insulin refers to longer-acting insulin that is meant to cover the body’s basal metabolic insulin requirement (regulating hepatic glucose production), in contrast to bolus or prandial insulin, which is meant to reduce glycaemic excursions after meals. Basal insulin is the preferred initial insulin formulation in patients with type 2 diabetes. Options include once- or twice-daily administration of intermediate-acting NPH or detemir insulin and the once-daily administration of glargine (U100 or U300) or degludec (U100 or U200). Long-acting insulin analogues (degludec \\\\[U100 or U200\\\\], glargine \\\\[U100 and U300\\\\], detemir) have a modestly lower absolute risk for hypoglycaemia compared with NPH insulin, but cost more \\\\[ [157](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR157), [158](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR158), [159](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR159), [160](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR160)\\\\]. However, in real-world settings where patients are treated to conventional treatment targets, initiation of NPH compared with determir or glargine U100 did not increase hypoglycaemia-related emergency department visits or hospital admissions \\\\[ [161](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR161)\\\\]. When comparing human and analogue insulins, cost differences can be large while differences in hypoglycaemia risk are modest and differences in glycaemic efficacy minimal.\\n\\nDegludec is associated with a lower risk of severe hypoglycaemia compared with glargine U100 insulin when targeting intensive glycaemic control in patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes at high risk of CVD; absolute incidence difference of 1.7% over 2 years (rate ratio 0.60; _p_ < 0.001 for superiority; OR 0.73; _p_ < 0.001 for superiority) \\\\[ [162](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR162)\\\\]. Biosimilar formulations are now available for glargine with similar efficacy profile and lower cost \\\\[ [163](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR163)\\\\]. No insulin has been shown to reduce risk for CVD \\\\[ [156](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR156)\\\\], but data suggest that glargine U100 and degludec do not increase risk for MACE \\\\[ [162](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR162), [164](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR164)\\\\].\\n\\nConcentrated formulations of degludec (U200) and glargine (U300) are available that allow injection of a reduced volume, a convenience for patients on higher doses. Glargine U300 is associated with a lower risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia compared with glargine U100 but requires a 10–14% higher dose of glargine for equivalent efficacy \\\\[ [165](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR165), [166](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR166), [167](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR167)\\\\].\\n\\nNot all patients have their blood glucose adequately controlled with basal insulin. In particular, patients with higher pre-treatment HbA1c, higher BMI, longer duration of disease, and a greater number of oral glucose-lowering medications are more likely to require intensified therapy \\\\[ [168](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR168)\\\\].\\n\\n### Other insulin formulations\\n\\nShort- and rapid-acting insulin formulations administered at mealtime are generally used to intensify basal insulin therapy in patients not meeting glycaemic targets. Options include human regular insulin, various analogues (aspart, glulisine and lispro), formulations (faster insulin aspart, lispro U200), biosimilars (lispro), and insulins with different routes of administration (inhaled). Rapid-acting insulin analogues have a modestly lower risk for hypoglycaemia compared with human regular insulin but at a higher cost. Various premixed formulations of human and analogue insulins are available and continue to be widely used in some regions, though they tend to have an increased risk of hypoglycemia as compared with basal insulin alone (Table [2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Tab2) and Fig. [7](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Fig7)).\\n\\n**Fig. 7**\\n\\nIntensifying to injectable therapies\\n\\n[Full size image](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5/figures/7)\\n\\n#### Other glucose-lowering medications\\n\\nOther oral glucose-lowering medications (i.e. meglitinides, α-glucosidase inhibitors, colesevelam, quick-release bromocriptine, pramlintide) are not used commonly in the USA and some are not licensed at all in Europe.

These are considered in Figs [2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Fig2), [3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Fig3), [4](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Fig4), [5](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Fig5), [6](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Fig6). For patients not reaching their target HbA1c, it is important to re-emphasise lifestyle measures, assess adherence and arrange timely follow-up (e.g. within 3–6 months) (Fig. [1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Fig1)).\\n\\n### Initial monotherapy\\n\\nMetformin remains the preferred option for initiating glucose-lowering medication in type 2 diabetes and should be added to lifestyle measures in newly diagnosed patients. This recommendation is based on the efficacy, safety, tolerability, low cost and extensive clinical experience with this medication. Results from a substudy of the UKPDS ( _n_ = 342) showed benefits of initial treatment with metformin on clinical outcomes related to diabetes, with less hypoglycaemia and weight gain than with insulin or sulfonylureas \\\\[ [98](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR98)\\\\].\\n\\n### Initial combination therapy compared with stepwise addition of glucose-lowering medication\\n\\nIn most patients, type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease, a consequence generally attributed to a steady decline of insulin secretory capacity. The practical impact of gradual loss of beta cell function is that achieving a glycaemic target with monotherapy is typically limited to several years. Stepwise therapy (i.e. adding medications to metformin to maintain HbA1c at target) is supported by clinical trials \\\\[ [3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR3)\\\\]. While there is some support for initial combination therapy due to the greater initial reduction of HbA1c than can be provided by metformin alone \\\\[ [190](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR190), [191](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR191)\\\\], there is little evidence that this approach is superior to sequential addition of medications for maintaining glycaemic control, or slowing the progression of diabetes. However, since the absolute effectiveness of most oral medications rarely exceeds an 11 mmol/mol (1%) reduction in HbA1c, initial combination therapy may be considered in patients presenting with HbA1c levels more than 17 mmol/mol (1.5%) above their target. Fixed-dose formulations can improve medication adherence when combination therapy is used \\\\[ [192](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR192)\\\\], and may help achieve glycaemic targets more rapidly \\\\[ [100](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR100)\\\\]. Potential benefits of combination therapy need to be weighed against the exposure of patients to multiple medications and potential side effects, increased cost and, in the case of fixed combination medications, less flexibility in dosing.\\n\\n### Choice of glucose-lowering medication after metformin\\n\\nAs detailed in the ‘ [Medications for lowering glucose](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Sec13)’ section _,_ the glucose-lowering medications that can be added to metformin have distinct profiles of action, efficacy and adverse effects \\\\[ [100](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR100), [193](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR193)\\\\]. The early introduction of basal insulin is well established, in particular when HbA1c levels are very high (>97 mmol/mol \\\\[>11%\\\\]), symptoms of hyperglycaemia are present or there is evidence of ongoing catabolism (e.g. weight loss). This constellation of symptoms can occur in type 2 diabetes but suggest insulin deficiency and raise the possibility of autoimmune (type 1) or pancreatogenic diabetes in which insulin would be the preferred therapy. While this remains the usual strategy for patients when HbA1c levels are very high, SGLT2 inhibitors \\\\[ [194](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR194)\\\\] and GLP-1 receptor agonists \\\\[ [195](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR195)\\\\] have demonstrated efficacy in patients with HbA1c levels exceeding 75 mmol/mol (9%), with the additional benefits of weight reduction and reduced risk of hypoglycaemia.\\n\\nEvidence from clinical trials supports the use of several of the SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists as add-on therapy for people with type 2 diabetes with an HbA1c >53 mmol/mol (>7%) and established CVD \\\\[ [48](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR48), [51](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR51), [52](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR52)\\\\]. However, since only 15–20% of patients with type 2 diabetes conform to the characteristics of patients in these trials, other clinical features need to be considered in the majority when selecting second medications to add to metformin (Figs [2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Fig2), [3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Fig3), [4](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Fig4), [5](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Fig5), [6](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Fig6)) \\\\[ [149](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR149), [196](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR196), [197](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR197), [198](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR198), [199](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR199), [200](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR200), [201](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR201), [202](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR202), [203](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR203), [204](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR204)\\\\].\\n\\nSulfonylureas and insulin are associated with an increased risk for causing hypoglycaemia and would not be preferred for patients in whom this is a concern. Furthermore, hypoglycaemia is distressing and so may reduce treatment adherence (Fig. [5](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Fig5)). For patients prioritizing weight loss or weight maintenance (Fig. [4](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Fig4)), important considerations include the weight reduction associated with SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists, the weight neutrality of DPP-4 inhibitors, and the weight gain associated with sulfonylureas, basal insulin and TZDs. An important consideration for society in general and for many patients in particular is the cost of medications; sulfonylureas, pioglitazone and recombinant human insulins are relatively inexpensive, although their cost may vary across regions. Short-term acquisition costs, longer-term treatment cost and cost-effectiveness should be considered in clinical decision making when data are available (Fig. [6](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Fig6)).\\n\\n### Intensification beyond two medications\\n\\nThe lack of a substantial response to one or more non-insulin therapies should raise the issue of adherence and, in those with weight loss, the possibility that the patient has autoimmune (type 1) or pancreatogenic diabetes. However, it is common in people with long-standing diabetes to require more than two glucose-lowering agents, often including insulin. Compared with the knowledge base guiding dual therapy of type 2 diabetes, there is less evidence guiding these choices \\\\[ [205](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR205)\\\\]. In general, intensification of treatment beyond two medications follows the same general principles as the addition of a second medication, with the assumption that the efficacy of third and fourth medications will be generally less than expected. No specific combination has demonstrated superiority except for those that include insulin and GLP-1 receptor agonists that have broad ranges of glycaemic efficacy. As more medications are added, there is an increased risk of adverse effects. It is important to consider medication interactions and whether regimen complexity may become an obstacle to adherence. Finally, with each additional medication comes increased costs, which can affect patient burden, medication-taking behaviour and medication effectiveness. \\\\[ [193](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR193), [205](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR205), [206](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR206), [207](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR207), [208](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR208), [209](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR209), [210](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR210), [211](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR211)\\\\].\\n\\nWhile most patients require intensification of glucose-lowering medications, some require medication reduction or discontinuation of medication, particularly if the therapy is ineffective or is exposing patients to a higher risk of side effects such as hypoglycaemia, or when glycaemic goals have changed due to a change in clinical circumstances (e.g. development of comorbidities or even healthy ageing). A guiding principle is that for all therapies the response should be reviewed at regular intervals, including the impact on efficacy (HbA1c, weight) and safety; the therapy should be stopped, or the dose reduced if there are minimal benefits or if harm outweighs any benefit. In particular, ceasing or reducing the dose of medications that have an increased risk of hypoglycaemia is important when any new glucose-lowering treatment (lifestyle or medication) is started (Fig. [7](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Fig7)) \\\\[ [40](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR40)\\\\]. HbA1c levels below 48 mmol/mol (6.5%) or substantially below the individualised glycaemic target should prompt consideration of stopping or reducing the dose of medications with risk of hypoglycaemia or weight gain.\\n\\n### Addition of injectable medications\\n\\nSee the ‘Insulin’ and ‘Basal insulin’ sections in ‘ [Medications for lowering glucose](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Sec13)’ for more medication details _._\\n\\nPatients often prefer combinations of oral medications to injectable medications. The range of combinations available with current oral medications allows many people to reach glycaemic targets safely. However, there is currently no evidence that any single medication or combination has durable effects and, for many patients, injectable medications become necessary within 5–10 years of diabetes diagnosis.\\n\\nEvidence from trials comparing GLP-1 receptor agonists and insulin (basal, premixed or basal-bolus) shows similar or even better efficacy in HbA1c reduction \\\\[ [212](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR212), [213](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR213)\\\\]. GLP-1 receptor agonists have a lower risk of hypoglycaemia and are associated with reductions in body weight compared with weight gain with insulin \\\\[ [212](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR212), [214](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR214)\\\\]. Some GLP-1 receptor agonists allow for once weekly injections, as opposed to daily or more often for insulin. Based on these considerations, a GLP-1 receptor agonist is the preferred option in a patient with a definite diagnosis of type 2 diabetes who needs injectable therapy. However, the tolerability and high cost of GLP-1 receptor agonists are important limitations to their use. If additional glucose lowering is needed despite therapy with a long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist, the addition of basal insulin is a reasonable option \\\\[ [215](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR215), [216](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR216)\\\\].\\n\\nAlternatively, the addition of insulin to oral medication regimens is well established. In particular, using basal insulin in combination with oral medications is effective, and has less hypoglycaemia and weight gain than combinations using premixed insulin formulations or prandial insulin \\\\[ [217](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR217)\\\\]. A standard approach for optimising basal insulin regimens is to titrate the dose based on a target fasting glucose concentration, which is a simple index of effectiveness. Either NPH insulin or long-acting insulin analogues are efficacious for controlling fasting glucose, although basal analogue formulations show reduced risks of hypoglycaemia, particularly overnight, when titrated to the same fasting glucose target as NPH insulin \\\\[ [157](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR157), [218](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR218)\\\\].\\n\\n### Beyond basal insulin\\n\\nIt has become common practice to approach insulin use in people with type 2 diabetes by following the established paradigms developed for those with type 1 diabetes. This includes multiple daily injections with doses of insulin analogues before meals that are adjusted based on ambient blood glucose and meal constituents. While this is reasonable for people with type 2 diabetes who are lean, insulinopenic and sensitive to exogenous insulin, it ignores the substantial differences in pathophysiology between most people with type 2 diabetes and type 1 diabetes. Most people with type 2 diabetes are obese and insulin resistant, requiring much larger doses of insulin and experiencing lower rates of hypoglycaemia than those with type 1 diabetes. In patients with type 2 diabetes, weight gain is a particularly problematic side effect of insulin use. Recent evidence supports the effectiveness of combinations of insulin with glucose-lowering medications that do not increase body weight. For example, SGLT2 inhibitors can be added to insulin regimens to lower blood glucose levels without increasing insulin doses, weight gain or hypoglycaemia \\\\[ [219](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR219), [220](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR220), [221](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR221)\\\\]. In a meta-analysis that studied the combination of either SGLT2 inhibitors or DPP-4 inhibitors with insulin, the SGLT2 inhibitor–insulin combination was associated with a greater reduction in HbA1c, an advantage in terms of body weight and no increase in the rates of hypoglycaemia \\\\[ [222](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR222), [223](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR223)\\\\]. Depending on baseline HbA1c, glycaemic profile and individual response, the insulin dose may need to be reduced to prevent hypoglycaemia when adding an SGLT2 inhibitor.\\n\\nThe combination of basal insulin and a GLP-1 receptor agonist has high efficacy, with recent evidence from clinical trials demonstrating the benefits of this combination to lower HbA1c and limit weight gain and hypoglycaemia compared with intensified insulin regimens \\\\[ [224](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR224), [225](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR225)\\\\]. Most data come from studies in which a GLP-1 receptor agonist is added to basal insulin. However, there is evidence that insulin added to a GLP-1 receptor agonist can also effectively lower HbA1c, although some weight gain results \\\\[ [215](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR215)\\\\]. Fixed-ratio combinations of insulin and GLP-1 receptor agonists are available and can decrease the number of injections compared with administering the medications separately \\\\[ [226](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR226), [227](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR227), [228](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR228)\\\\].\\n\\nA final approach to glycaemic management when basal insulin plus oral medications is insufficient to achieve HbA1c targets is intensified insulin regimens (Figs [7](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Fig7) and [8](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Fig8)). DSMES focused on insulin therapy is particularly helpful when intensified insulin therapy is considered. Referral to a diabetes specialist team should be considered in cases where the provider is uncomfortable or unfamiliar with intensification, poor outcomes continue despite intensification, or patients have other issues that complicate intensification. Intensified insulin regimens include (1) one or more daily injections of rapid- or short-acting insulin before meals (prandial insulin) or (2) switching to one to three daily administrations of a fixed combination of short- and long-acting insulin (premixed or biphasic insulins) \\\\[ [229](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR229), [230](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR230)\\\\]. When adding prandial insulin, giving one injection with the largest meal of the day is a simple and safe approach \\\\[ [231](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR231)\\\\]. Over time, if glycaemic targets are not met with one dose of prandial insulin daily, additional prandial injections can be added to other meals \\\\[ [232](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR232)\\\\]. Results of meta-analyses suggest a modestly greater reduction in HbA1c with basal-prandial regimens compared with biphasic insulin regimens, but at the expense of greater weight gain \\\\[ [233](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR233), [234](http://link.springer.com/link.springer.com#ref-CR234), [235](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR235)\\\\]. While still commonly used, we do not generally advocate premixed insulin regimens, particularly those administered three times daily, for routine use when intensifying insulin regimens (Fig. [7](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Fig7)).\\n\\n**Fig. 8**\\n\\nConsidering oral therapy in combination with injectable therapies\\n\\n[Full size image](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5/figures/8)\\n\\nContinuous insulin infusion using insulin pumps may have a role in a small minority of people with type 2 diabetes \\\\[ [236](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR236)\\\\].\\n\\n### Access and cost\\n\\nThe availability of glucose-lowering medications, patient support systems and blood glucose-monitoring devices can differ worldwide, depending on a region’s economy, culture and healthcare system. Cost of and access to newer medications and insulin remain important issues throughout the world. Although the economics of diabetes care is complex and broadly includes the costs to society of diabetic complications and long-term outcomes, the cost of drugs and the affordability of treatment are often the primary basis for decision making. Within healthcare systems, variance in medication coverage is based on different assessments of cost-effectiveness. This results in huge disparities in the cost of new and old glucose-lowering medications in some countries, limiting access to the full range of diabetes therapies in large segments of the population and creating a two-tiered system of treatment. Since glycaemic management remains a cornerstone of the prevention of diabetes complications, these disparities raise questions of fairness, equity and overall public health. Nonetheless, the use of less expensive agents, such as metformin, sulfonylureas and human insulin, remain effective options (Figs [2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Fig2) and [6](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#Fig6)). Redoubling lifestyle management efforts can also have great impact, but behavioural intervention and support can also be costly, and socioeconomic barriers to improving lifestyle are well-described \\\\[ [237](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR237)\\\\].\\n\\n### Emerging technology\\n\\nThere is an increasing call for the use of technology and telemedicine to improve patients’ health \\\\[ [238](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR238)\\\\]. Many types of inputs can be digitalised, such as blood glucose levels, time spent exercising, steps walked, energy ingested, medication doses administered, blood pressure and weight. Patterns in these variables can be identified by software, leading to specific treatment recommendations supported by real-time algorithms. Telemedicine incorporates multiple types of communication services, such as two-way video, email, texting, smartphones, tablets, wireless monitors, decision support tools and other forms of telecommunication technologies. Results overall suggest a modest improvement in glycaemic control \\\\[ [239](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR239), [240](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-018-4729-5#ref-CR240)\\\\].\\n\\n## Key knowledge gaps\\n\\nDespite over 200 years of research on lifestyle management of diabetes and more than 50 years of comparative-effectiveness research in diabetes, innumerable unanswered questions regarding the management of type 2 diabetes remain. In the context of our current consensus recommendations, the following is an incomplete discussion of vexing issues that must be addressed.\\n\\nEvolving areas of current investigation will provide improvements in diabetes care and hold great hope for new treatments.\\n\\n- Implementation science. The tools available to prevent and treat diabetes are vastly improved. However, implementation of effective innovation has lagged behind.\\n\\n- Basic science. Our understanding of the basic mechanisms of diabetes, the development of complications, and the treatment of both, though continuously advancing, has highlighted how much we do not know.\\n\\n- Personalised/precision medicine. Though promising, these -omics and big data approaches addressing both personal and environmental factors and their interaction are largely unrealised in diabetes care and will require large investments and coordination to have impact.\\n\\n- Informatics. The benefits and role of enhanced monitoring of glucose and other variables leveraged with real-time informatics-based approaches to adapt treatment on an individual basis has great potential but has not been elucidated.\\n\\n- Overweight/obesity. Current therapy is clearly inadequate. Innovation in methods and implementation would transform diabetes prevention and care. Understanding the biology, psychology and sociology of obesity to identify pharmacological, behavioural and political approaches to preventing and treating this principal cause of type 2 diabetes is essential.\\n\\n- Lifestyle management and DSMES. Though the benefits of these approaches are clear, better paradigms on how to target, individualise and sustain the effects are needed.\\n\\n- Beta-cell function. Preserving and enhancing beta cell function is perceived as the holy grail of diabetes and yet effective techniques are inadequately developed.\\n\\n- Translational research. There is a huge gap between the knowledge gained from clinical trials and application of that information in clinical practice. This gap should be filled with pragmatic studies and other designs that include costs, measures of patient preference and other patient-recorded outcome measures. Patients and other stakeholders should have more input into trial designs and outcomes. Pragmatic designs will enhance generalisability of results and reduce cost. Better application of ‘real-world evidence’ will complement randomised trial evidence.\\n\\n- Drug development. New medications will require demonstration of broad efficacy for glucose, comorbidities and/or complications as well as safety and tolerability to compete in the marketplace.\\n\\n- Complications. Steatohepatitis, HF, non-albuminuric CKD, chronic mental illness and other emerging issues are complications in diabetes that may supplant classical microvascular and macrovascular disease in importance and impact. Understanding optimal diagnostic, screening and treatment strategies is urgently needed.\\n\\n\\nOther areas of importance include better segmentation of ‘type 2 diabetes’, as well as appropriate diagnosis of secondary diabetes, which should allow more informed individualisation of care. Better data on optimal approaches to diabetes management in frail and older adult patients is urgently required considering the controversy around glycaemic targets and the benefits and harms of specific treatments from lifestyle management to medications. Current approaches to the management of type 2 diabetes in adolescents and young adults do not seem to alter the loss of beta cell function and most individuals in this age group quickly transition to insulin therapy. Studies to guide optimal therapy in this emerging population with a terrifyingly high risk of early disability is an immediate need.\\n\\nThere are enduring questions that continue to challenge guideline development. For example, does metformin provide cardiovascular benefit in patients with type 2 diabetes early in the natural history of diabetes, as suggested by the UKPDS study? Is metformin’s role as first-line medication management truly evidence-based or a quirk of history? Though the rationale for early combination therapy targeting normal levels of glycaemia in early diabetes is seductive, clinical trial evidence to support specific combinations and targets is essentially non-existent. As the cost implications for these approaches is enormous, evidence is desperately needed. Different models of care are being implemented globally. Defining optimal cost-effective approaches to care, particularly in the management of patients (multi-morbidity), is essential.\\n\\nNew questions arise from the recent cardiovascular outcomes studies. Do the cardiovascular and renal benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists demonstrated in patients with established CVD extend to lower-risk patients? Is there additive benefit of use of GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors for prevention of cardiovascular and renal events? If so, in what populations?\\n\\nAddressing these and other vital clinical questions will require additional investment in basic, translational, clinical and implementation research. More time- and cost-efficient research paradigms to address patient-centred endpoints will need to be developed through regulatory reform and leveraging informatics and coordinated learning healthcare systems. The increasing burden of cardiorenal metabolic disease in terms of incidence, prevalence and cost is an existential threat to society. Urgent attention to improve prevention and treatment is of the essence.\\n\\nThe management of hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes has become extraordinarily complex with the number of glucose-lowering medications now available. Patient-centred decision making and support and consistent efforts to improve diet and exercise remain the foundation of all glycaemic management. Initial use of metformin, followed by addition of glucose-lowering medications based on patient comorbidities and concerns is recommended as we await answers to the many questions that remain.\\n\\n## Data availability\\n\\nThe details of the search strategy, the results and the classification for the included articles are available at [https://doi.org/10.17632/h5rcnxpk8w.1](https://doi.org/10.17632/h5rcnxpk8w.1).\\n\\n## Change history\\n\\n## Abbreviations\\n\\nARR:\\n\\nAbsolute risk reduction\\n\\nASCVD:\\n\\nAtherosclerotic cardiovascular disease\\n\\nCANVAS:\\n\\nCanagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study\\n\\nCKD:\\n\\nChronic kidney disease\\n\\nCVD:\\n\\nCardiovascular disease\\n\\nCVOT:\\n\\nCardiovascular outcomes trial\\n\\nDKA:\\n\\nDiabetic ketoacidosis\\n\\nDPP-4:\\n\\nDipeptidyl peptidase-4\\n\\nDPP-4i:\\n\\nDipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor\\n\\nDSMES:\\n\\nDiabetes self-management education and support\\n\\nEMPA-REG OUTCOME:\\n\\nEmpagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients\\n\\nESRD:\\n\\nEnd-stage renal disease\\n\\nEXSCEL:\\n\\nExenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering\\n\\nGLP-1:\\n\\nGlucagon-like peptide-1\\n\\nGLP-1 RA:\\n\\nGlucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist\\n\\nHF:\\n\\nHeart failure\\n\\nLEADER:\\n\\nLiraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of of Cardiovascular Outcomes Results\\n\\nMACE:\\n\\nMajor adverse cardiac events\\n\\nMI:\\n\\nMyocardial infarction\\n\\nMNT:\\n\\nMedical nutrition therapy\\n\\nRCT:\\n\\nRandomised clinical trial\\n\\nSGLT2:\\n\\nSodium–glucose cotransporter-2\\n\\nSGLT2i:\\n\\nSodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor\\n\\nSMBG:\\n\\nSelf-monitoring of blood glucose\\n\\nSU:\\n\\nSulfonylurea\\n\\nSUSTAIN 6:\\n\\nTrial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long-term Outcomes with Semaglutide in Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes\\n\\nT2DM:\\n\\nType 2 diabetes mellitus\\n\\nTZD:\\n\\nThiazolidinedione\\n\\nUKPDS:\\n\\nUK Prospective Diabetes Study\\n\\n## References\\n\\n001.

They should also be taught how to modify the insulin dose (correction dose) based on concurrent glycemia, glycemic trends (if available), sick-day management, and anticipated physical activity. **B**\\n\\n- **9.6** Glucagon should be prescribed for all individuals taking insulin or at high risk for hypoglycemia. Family, caregivers, school personnel, and others providing support to these individuals should know its location and be educated on how to administer it. Glucagon preparations that do not require reconstitution are preferred. **E**\\n\\n- **9.7** Insulin treatment plan and insulin-taking behavior should be reevaluated at regular intervals (e.g., every 3–6 months) and adjusted to incorporate specific factors that impact choice of treatment and ensure achievement of individualized glycemic goals. **E**\\n\\n\\n### Insulin Therapy\\n\\nInsulin treatment is essential for individuals with type 1 diabetes because the hallmark of type 1 diabetes is absent or near-absent β-cell function. In addition to hyperglycemia, insulinopenia can contribute to other metabolic disturbances like hypertriglyceridemia and ketoacidosis as well as tissue catabolism that can be life threatening. Severe metabolic decompensation can be, and was, mostly prevented with once- or twice-daily injections for the six or seven decades after the discovery of insulin. Over the past four decades, evidence has accumulated supporting more intensive insulin replacement, using multiple daily injections of insulin or continuous subcutaneous administration through an insulin pump, as providing the best combination of effectiveness and safety for people with type 1 diabetes.\\n\\nThe Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) demonstrated that intensive therapy with multiple daily injections or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) reduced A1C and was associated with improved long-term outcomes ( [1](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B1)– [3](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B3)). The study was carried out with short-acting (regular) and intermediate-acting (NPH) human insulins. In this landmark trial, lower A1C with intensive control (7%) led to ∼50% reductions in microvascular complications over 6 years of treatment. However, intensive therapy was associated with a higher rate of severe hypoglycemia than conventional treatment (62 compared with 19 episodes per 100 patient-years of therapy) ( [1](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B1)). Follow-up of participants from the DCCT demonstrated fewer macrovascular and microvascular complications in the group that received intensive treatment. Achieving intensive glycemic goals during the active treatment period of the study had a beneficial impact over the 20 years after the active treatment component of the study ended ( [1](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B1)– [3](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B3)).\\n\\nInsulin replacement plans typically consist of basal insulin, mealtime insulin, and correction insulin ( [4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B4)). Basal insulin includes NPH insulin, long-acting insulin analogs, and continuous delivery of rapid-acting insulin via an insulin pump. Basal insulin analogs have longer duration of action with flatter, more constant and consistent plasma concentrations and activity profiles than NPH insulin; rapid-acting analogs (RAA) have a quicker onset and peak and shorter duration of action than regular human insulin. In people with type 1 diabetes, treatment with analog insulins is associated with less hypoglycemia and weight gain as well as lower A1C compared with injectable human insulins ( [5](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B5)– [7](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B7)). More recently, two injectable ultra-rapid-acting analog (URAA) insulin formulations were developed to accelerate absorption and provide more activity in the first portion of their profile compared with the other RAA ( [8](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B8), [9](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B9)). Inhaled human insulin has a rapid peak and shortened duration of action compared with RAA ( [10](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B10)) (see also subsection alternative insulin routes in pharmacologic therapy for adults with type 2diabetes). These newer formulations may cause less hypoglycemia, while improving postprandial glucose excursions and administration flexibility (in relation to prandial intake), compared with RAA ( [10](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B10)– [12](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B12)). In addition, longer-acting basal analogs (U-300 glargine or degludec) may confer a lower hypoglycemia risk compared with U-100 glargine in individuals with type 1 diabetes ( [13](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B13), [14](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B14)).\\n\\nDespite the advantages of insulin analogs in individuals with type 1 diabetes, the expense and/or intensity of treatment required for their use may be prohibitive. There are multiple approaches to insulin treatment. The central precept in the management of type 1 diabetes is that some form of insulin be given in a defined treatment plan tailored to the individual to prevent diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and minimize clinically relevant hypoglycemia while achieving the individual’s glycemic goals. The impact of the introduction of interchangeable biosimilars and unbranded versions of some analog products as well as current and upcoming price reductions on insulin access need to be evaluated. Reassessment of insulin-taking behavior and adjustment of treatment plans to account for specific factors, including cost, that impact choice of treatment is recommended at regular intervals (every 3–6 months).\\n\\nMost studies comparing multiple daily injections with CSII have been relatively small and of short duration. A systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that CSII via pump therapy has modest advantages for lowering A1C (−0.30% \\\\[95% CI −0.58 to −0.02\\\\]) and for reducing severe hypoglycemia rates in children and adults ( [15](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B15)). Use of CSII is associated with improvement in quality of life, particularly in areas related to fear of hypoglycemia and diabetes distress, compared with multiple daily injections of insulin ( [16](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B16), [17](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B17)). However, there is no consensus to guide the choice of injection or pump therapy in a given individual, and research to guide this decision-making is needed ( [4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B4)). Integration of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) into the treatment plan soon after diagnosis improves glycemic outcomes, decreases hypoglycemic events, and improves quality of life for individuals with type 1 diabetes ( [18](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B18)– [23](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B23)). Its use is now considered standard of care for most people with type 1 diabetes ( [4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B4)) (see Section 7, “ [Diabetes Technology](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S007)”). Reduction of nocturnal hypoglycemia in individuals with type 1 diabetes using insulin pumps with CGM is improved by automatic suspension of insulin delivery at a preset glucose level, with further improvements when using devices with predictive low glucose insulin delivery suspension ( [24](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B24), [25](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B25)).\\n\\nAutomated insulin delivery (AID) systems are safe and effective for people with type 1 diabetes. Randomized controlled trials and real-world studies have demonstrated the ability of commercially available systems to improve achievement of glycemic goals while reducing the risk of hypoglycemia ( [26](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B26)– [31](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B31)). Data are emerging on the safety and effectiveness of do-it-yourself systems ( [32](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B32), [33](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B33)). Evidence suggests that an AID hybrid closed-loop system is superior to AID sensor-augmented pump therapy for increased percentage of time in range and reduction of hypoglycemia ( [34](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B34), [35](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B35)).\\n\\nIntensive insulin management using a version of CSII and CGM should be considered in individuals with type 1 diabetes whenever feasible. AID systems are preferred and should be considered for individuals with type 1 diabetes who are capable of using the device safely (either by themselves or with a caregiver) to improve time in range and reduce A1C and hypoglycemia ( [26](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B26), [28](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B28)– [31](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B31), [36](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B36)– [42](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B42)). When choosing among insulin delivery systems, individual preferences, cost, insulin type, dosing plan, and self-management capabilities should be considered. See Section 7, “ [Diabetes Technology](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S007),” for a full discussion of insulin delivery devices.\\n\\nIn general, individuals with type 1 diabetes require approximately 30–50% of their daily insulin as basal and the remainder as prandial ( [43](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B43)). This proportion is dependent on a number of factors, including but not limited to carbohydrate consumption, age, pregnancy status, and puberty stage ( [4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B4), [44](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B44)– [48](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B48)). Total daily insulin requirements can be estimated based on weight, with typical doses ranging from 0.4 to 1.0 units/kg/day. Higher amounts may be required during puberty, menses, and medical illness. The _American Diabetes Association/JDRF Type 1 Diabetes Sourcebook_ notes 0.5 units/kg/day as a typical starting dose in adults with type 1 diabetes who are metabolically stable, with approximately one-half administered as prandial insulin given to manage blood glucose after meals and the remaining portion as basal insulin to manage glycemia in the periods between meal absorption ( [49](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B49)). Starting doses and those soon after diagnosis may be higher, if an individual presents with ketoacidosis, or lower (0.2–0.6 units/kg), particularly in young children and those with continued endogenous insulin production (during the partial remission phase or “honeymoon period,” or in people who present with type 1 diabetes in adulthood) ( [49](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B49)– [52](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B52)). This guideline provides detailed information on intensification of therapy to meet individualized needs. In addition, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) position statement “Type 1 Diabetes Management Through the Life Span” provides a thorough overview of type 1 diabetes treatment ( [53](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B53)).\\n\\nTypical multidose treatment plans for individuals with type 1 diabetes combine premeal use of prandial insulins with a longer-acting formulation. The long-acting basal dose is titrated to regulate overnight and fasting glucose. Postprandial glucose excursions are best managed by a well-timed injection or inhalation of prandial insulin. Prandial insulin should ideally be administered prior to meal consumption; however, the optimal time to administer varies based on the pharmacokinetics of the formulation (regular, RAA, or inhaled), the premeal blood glucose level, and carbohydrate consumption. Recommendations for prandial insulin dose administration should therefore be individualized. Physiologic insulin secretion varies with glycemia, meal size, meal composition, and tissue demands for glucose. To approach this variability in people using insulin treatment, strategies have evolved to adjust prandial doses based on predicted needs. Thus, education on how to adjust prandial insulin to account for nutritional intake and the correction dose based on premeal glucose levels, anticipated activity, and sick-day management can be effective and should be offered to most individuals ( [54](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B54)– [59](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B59)). Education regarding adjustment of prandial insulin dose for glycemic trends should be provided to individuals who are using CGM alone or an AID system ( [60](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B60)– [63](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B63)). Further adjustment of prandial insulin doses for nutritional intake of protein and fat, in addition to carbohydrates, is recommended but may be more feasible for individuals using CSII than for those using multiple daily injections ( [56](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B56)). With some AID systems, use of a simplified meal announcement method may be an alternative for prandial insulin dosing ( [31](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B31), [64](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B64)) (see Section 5, “ [Facilitating Positive Health Behaviors and Well-being to Improve Health Outcomes](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S005),” and Section 7, “ [Diabetes Technology](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S007)”).\\n\\nDue to the risk of hypoglycemia with insulin treatment, all individuals with type 1 diabetes should be prescribed glucagon. Individuals with type 1 diabetes and/or those in close contact with individuals with type 1 diabetes should be educated on the use and administration of the individual’s prescribed glucagon product. The glucagon product available to individuals may differ based on coverage and cost, however those that do not require reconstitution are preferred for ease of administration ( [65](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B65), [66](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B66)). Clinicians should routinely review the individual’s access to glucagon, as appropriate glucagon prescribing is low ( [67](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B67), [68](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B68)). See Section 6, “ [Glycemic Goals and Hypoglycemia](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S006),” for additional information on hypoglycemia and glucagon in individuals with diabetes. The 2021 ADA/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) consensus report on the management of type 1 diabetes in adults summarizes different insulin plans and glucose monitoring strategies in individuals with type 1 diabetes ( **[Fig. 9.1](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.1)** and **[Table 9.1](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T9.1)**) ( [4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B4)).\\n\\n#### Figure 9.1.\\n\\nChoices of insulin plans in people with type 1 diabetes.

( [4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B4)).\\n\\n#### Table 9.1.\\n\\nExamples of subcutaneous insulin treatment plans\\n\\n| Plans | Timing and distribution | Advantages | Disadvantages | Adjusting doses |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| Plans that more closely mimic normal insulin secretion |\\n| Insulin pump therapy (also including AID systems: hybrid closed-loop, low-glucose suspend, CGM-augmented open-loop, BGM-augmented open-loop) | Basal delivery of URAA or RAA; generally 30–50% of TDD. Mealtime and correction: URAA or RAA by bolus based on ICR and/or ISF and target glucose, with premeal insulin ∼15 min before eating. | Can adjust basal rates for varying insulin sensitivity by time of day, for exercise, and for sick days. Flexibility in meal timing and content. Pump can deliver insulin in increments of fractions of units. Potential for integration with CGM for AID systems. TIR % highest and TBR % lowest with: hybrid closed-loop > low-glucose suspend > CGM-augmented open-loop > BGM-augmented open-loop. | Most expensive plan. Must continuously wear one or more devices. Risk of rapid development of ketosis or DKA with interruption of insulin delivery. Potential reactions to adhesives and site infections. Most technically complex approach (harder for people with lower numeracy or literacy skills). | Mealtime insulin: if carbohydrate counting is accurate, change ICR if glucose after meal consistently out of target. Correction insulin: adjust ISF and/or target glucose if correction does not consistently bring glucose into range. Basal rates: adjust based on overnight, fasting or daytime glucose outside of activity of URAA/RAA bolus. |\\n| MDI: LAA + flexible doses of URAA or RAA at meals | LAA once daily (insulin detemir or insulin glargine may require twice-daily dosing); generally 30–50% of TDD. Mealtime and correction: URAA or RAA based on ICR and/or ISF and target glucose. | Can use pens for all components. Flexibility in meal timing and content. Insulin analogs cause less hypoglycemia than human insulins. | At least four daily injections. Most costly insulins. Smallest increment of insulin is 1 unit (0.5 unit with some pens). LAAs may not cover strong dawn phenomenon (rise in glucose in early morning hours) as well as pump therapy. | Mealtime insulin: if carbohydrate counting is accurate, change ICR if glucose after meal consistently out of target. Correction insulin: adjust ISF and/or target glucose if correction does not consistently bring glucose into range. LAA: based on overnight or fasting glucose or daytime glucose outside of activity time course, or URAA or RAA injections. |\\n| MDI plans with less flexibility |\\n| Four injections daily with fixed doses of Ν and RAA | Pre-breakfast: RAA ∼20% of TDD. Pre-lunch: RAA ∼10% of TDD. Pre-dinner: RAA ∼10% of TDD. Bedtime: Ν ∼50% of TDD. | May be feasible if unable to carbohydrate count. All meals have RAA coverage. Ν is less expensive than LAAs. | Shorter duration RAA may lead to basal deficit during day; may need twice-daily N. Greater risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia with N. Requires relatively consistent mealtimes and carbohydrate intake. | Pre-breakfast RAA: based on BGM after breakfast or before lunch. Pre-lunch RAA: based on BGM after lunch or before dinner. Pre-dinner RAA: based on BGM after dinner or at bedtime. Evening N: based on fasting or overnight BGM. |\\n| Four injections daily with fixed doses of Ν and R | Pre-breakfast: R ∼20% of TDD.

Least expensive insulins. | Greater risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia with N. Greater risk of delayed post-meal hypoglycemia with R. Requires relatively consistent mealtimes and carbohydrate intake. R must be injected at least 30 min before meal for better effect. | Pre-breakfast R: based on BGM after breakfast or before lunch. Pre-lunch R: based on BGM after lunch or before dinner. Pre-dinner R: based on BGM after dinner or at bedtime. Evening N: based on fasting or overnight BGM. |\\n| Plans with fewer daily injections |\\n| Three injections daily: Ν + R or Ν + RAA | Pre-breakfast: Ν ∼ 40% TDD + R or RAA ∼15% TDD. Pre-dinner: R or RAA ∼15% TDD. Bedtime: Ν ∼ 30% TDD. | Morning insulins can be mixed in one syringe. May be appropriate for those who cannot take injection in middle of day. Morning Ν covers lunch to some extent. Same advantages of RAAs over R. Least (N + R) or less expensive insulins than MDI with analogs. | Greater risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia with Ν than LAAs. Greater risk of delayed post-meal hypoglycemia with R than RAAs. Requires relatively consistent mealtimes and carbohydrate intake. Coverage of post-lunch glucose often suboptimal. R must be injected at least 30 min before meal for better effect. | Morning N: based on pre-dinner BGM. Morning R: based on pre-lunch BGM. Morning RAA: based on post-breakfast or pre-lunch BGM. Pre-dinner R: based on bedtime BGM. Pre-dinner RAA: based on post-dinner or bedtime BGM.

Pre-dinner: Ν ∼ 30% TDD + R or RAA ∼15% TDD. | Least number of injections for people with strong preference for this. Insulins can be mixed in one syringe. Least (N + R) or less (N + RAA) expensive insulins vs. analogs. Eliminates need for doses during the day. | Risk of hypoglycemia in afternoon or middle of night from N. Fixed mealtimes and meal content. Coverage of post-lunch glucose often suboptimal. Difficult to reach targets for blood glucose without hypoglycemia. | Morning N: based on pre-dinner BGM. Morning R: based on pre-lunch BGM. Morning RAA: based on post-breakfast or pre-lunch BGM. Evening R: based on bedtime BGM. Evening RAA: based on post-dinner or bedtime BGM. Evening N: based on fasting BGM. |\\n\\n### Insulin Administration Technique\\n\\nEnsuring that individuals and/or caregivers understand correct insulin administration technique is important to optimize glycemic management and insulin use safety. Thus, it is important that insulin be delivered into the proper tissue in the correct way. Recommendations have been published elsewhere outlining best practices for insulin administration ( [69](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B69)). Proper insulin administration technique includes injection or infusion (for CSII or AID systems) into appropriate body areas, injection or infusion site rotation, appropriate care of injection or infusion sites to avoid infection or other complications, and avoidance of intramuscular (IM) insulin delivery. Selection of method of administration (vial and syringe, insulin pen, connected insulin pens/devices, or insulin pumps) will depend on a variety of individual-specific factors and needs, cost and coverage, and individual preferences. Reassessment of the appropriate administration technique via whichever method is used should be completed during routine follow-up.\\n\\nExogenously delivered insulin should be injected into subcutaneous tissue, not intramuscularly. Recommended sites for insulin administration include the abdomen, thigh, buttock, and upper arm. Insulin absorption from IM sites differs from that in subcutaneous sites and is also influenced by the activity of the muscle. Inadvertent IM injection can lead to unpredictable insulin absorption and variable effects on glucose and is associated with frequent and unexplained hypoglycemia. Risk for IM insulin delivery is increased in younger, leaner individuals when injecting into the limbs rather than truncal sites (abdomen and buttocks) and when using longer needles. Recent evidence supports the use of short needles (e.g., 4-mm pen needles) as effective and well tolerated when compared with longer needles, including a study performed in adults with obesity ( [70](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B70)).\\n\\nInjection or infusion site rotation is additionally necessary to avoid lipohypertrophy, an accumulation of subcutaneous fat in response to the adipogenic actions of insulin at a site of multiple injections. Lipohypertrophy appears as soft, smooth raised areas several centimeters in breadth and can contribute to erratic insulin absorption, increased glycemic variability, and unexplained hypoglycemic episodes. People treated with insulin and/or caregivers should receive education about proper injection or infusion site rotation and how to recognize and avoid areas of lipohypertrophy. As noted in **[Table 4.1](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S004)**, examination of insulin injection sites for the presence of lipohypertrophy, as well as assessment of administration device use and injection technique, are key components of a comprehensive diabetes medical evaluation and treatment plan. Proper insulin injection or infusion technique may lead to more effective use of this therapy and, as such, holds the potential for improved clinical outcomes.\\n\\n### Noninsulin Treatments for Type 1 Diabetes\\n\\nInjectable and oral glucose-lowering medications have been studied for their efficacy as adjunct to insulin treatment of type 1 diabetes. Pramlintide is based on the naturally occurring β-cell peptide amylin and is approved for use in adults with type 1 diabetes. Clinical trials have demonstrated a modest reduction in A1C (0.3–0.4%) and modest weight loss (∼1 kg) with pramlintide ( [71](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B71)). Similar results have been reported for several agents currently approved only for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The addition of metformin in adults with type 1 diabetes was associated with small reductions in body weight, insulin dose, and lipid levels but did not sustainably improve A1C ( [72](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B72), [73](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B73)). The largest clinical trials of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) in type 1 diabetes have been conducted with liraglutide 1.8 mg daily, and results showed modest A1C reductions (∼0.4%), decreases in weight (∼5 kg), and reductions in insulin doses ( [74](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B74), [75](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B75)). Similarly, sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been studied in clinical trials in people with type 1 diabetes, and results showed improvements in A1C, reduced body weight, and improved blood pressure ( [76](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B76)); however, SGLT2 inhibitor use in type 1 diabetes was associated with an increased rate of DKA. The SGLT1/2 inhibitor sotagliflozin has been studied in clinical trials in people with type 1 diabetes, and results showed improvements in A1C and body weight ( [77](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B77)); however, sotagliflozin use was associated with an eightfold increase in DKA compared with placebo ( [78](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B78)). The studies that led to the approved indication for heart failure (HF) excluded individuals with type 1 diabetes or a history of DKA ( [79](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B79), [80](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B80)). See section prevention and treatment of heart failure within Section 10, “ [Cardiovascular Disease and Risk Management](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S010),” for information on risk mitigation with the use of SGLT inhibitors in those with type 1 diabetes. The risks and benefits of adjunctive agents continue to be evaluated, with consensus statements providing guidance on patient selection and precautions ( [81](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B81)).\\n\\nThere are currently no approved therapies for preservation of C-peptide or delaying the progression of clinical type 1 diabetes. Higher C-peptide levels have been associated with better A1C, lower risk of retinopathy, lower risk of nephropathy, and lower risk of severe hypoglycemia ( [82](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B82)). Several therapies, including verapamil and monoclonal antibodies, are currently under active investigation.\\n\\n## Surgical Treatment for Type 1 Diabetes\\n\\n### Pancreas and Islet Transplantation\\n\\nSuccessful pancreas and islet transplantation can normalize glucose levels and mitigate microvascular complications of type 1 diabetes. However, people receiving these treatments require lifelong immunosuppression to prevent graft rejection and/or recurrence of autoimmune islet destruction. Given the potential adverse effects of immunosuppressive therapy, pancreas transplantation should be reserved for people with type 1 diabetes undergoing simultaneous kidney transplantation, following kidney transplantation, or for those with recurrent ketoacidosis or severe hypoglycemia despite intensive glycemic management ( [83](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B83)). In much of the world, allogenic islet transplantation is regulated as an organ transplant. However, in the U.S., allogenic islet transplantation is regulated as a cell therapy, and the first such allogeneic islet cell therapy, donislecel-jujn, was approved in 2023. Donislecel is indicated for the treatment of adults with type 1 diabetes who are unable to approach their A1C goal because of current repeated episodes of severe hypoglycemia despite intensive diabetes management and education.\\n\\nThe 2021 ADA/EASD consensus report on the management of type 1 diabetes in adults offers a simplified overview of indications for β-cell replacement therapy in people with type 1 diabetes ( **[Fig. 9.2](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.2)**) ( [4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B4)).\\n\\n#### Figure 9.2.\\n\\nSimplified overview of indications for β-cell replacement therapy in people with type 1 diabetes. The two main forms of β-cell replacement therapy are whole-pancreas transplantation or islet cell transplantation. β-Cell replacement therapy can be combined with kidney transplantation if the individual has end-stage renal disease, which may be performed simultaneously or after kidney transplantation. All decisions about transplantation must balance the surgical risk, metabolic need, and the choice of the individual with diabetes. GFR, glomerular filtration rate. Reprinted from Holt et al.

Consider the effects on cardiovascular and renal comorbidities; effectiveness; hypoglycemia risk; impact on weight, cost and access; risk for adverse reactions and tolerability; and individual preferences ( **[Fig. 9.3](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.3)** and **[Table 9.2](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T9.2)**). **E**\\n\\n- **9.10** The glucose-lowering treatment plan should consider approaches that support weight management goals ( **[Fig. 9.3](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.3)** and **[Table 9.2](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T9.2)**) for adults with type 2 diabetes. **A**\\n\\n- **9.11** For adults with type 2 diabetes, use pharmacological strategies that provide sufficient effectiveness to achieve and maintain the intended treatment goals. **A**\\n\\n- **9.12** Treatment modification (intensification or deintensification) for adults not meeting individualized treatment goals should not be delayed. **A**\\n\\n- **9.13** Medication plan and medication-taking behavior should be reevaluated at regular intervals (e.g., every 3–6 months) and adjusted as needed to incorporate specific factors that impact choice of treatment ( **[Fig. 4.1](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S004)** and **[Table 9.2](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T9.2)**). **E**\\n\\n- **9.14** Early combination therapy can be considered in adults with type 2 diabetes at treatment initiation to shorten time to attainment of individualized treatment goals. **A**\\n\\n- **9.15** In adults with type 2 diabetes without cardiovascular and/or kidney disease, pharmacologic agents should address both the individualized glycemic and weight goals ( **[Fig. 9.3](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.3)**). **A**\\n\\n- **9.16** In adults with type 2 diabetes who have not achieved their individualized glycemic goals, selection of subsequent glucose-lowering agents should take into consideration the individualized glycemic and weight goals as well as the presence of other metabolic comorbidities and the risk of hypoglycemia. **A**\\n\\n- **9.17** In adults with type 2 diabetes who have not achieved their individualized weight goals, additional weight management interventions (e.g., intensification of lifestyle modifications, structured weight management programs, pharmacologic agents, or metabolic surgery, as appropriate) are recommended. **A**\\n\\n- **9.18** In adults with type 2 diabetes and established or high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure (HF), and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD), the treatment plan should include agent(s) that reduce cardiovascular and kidney disease risk (e.g., sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor \\\\[SGLT2\\\\] and/or glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist \\\\[GLP-1 RA\\\\]) ( **[Fig. 9.3](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.3)**, **[Table 9.2](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T9.2)**, **[Table 10.3 _B_](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S010)**, and **[Table 10.3 _C_](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S010)**) for glycemic management and comprehensive cardiovascular risk reduction, independent of A1C and in consideration of person-specific factors ( **[Fig. 9.3](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.3)**) (see Section 10, “ [Cardiovascular Disease and Risk Management](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S010),” for details on cardiovascular risk reduction recommendations). **A**\\n\\n- **9.19** In adults with type 2 diabetes who have HF (with either reduced or preserved ejection fraction), an SGLT2 inhibitor is recommended, for glycemic management and prevention of HF hospitalizations (see Section 10, “ [Cardiovascular Disease and Risk Management](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S010),” for details on cardiovascular risk reduction recommendations). **A**\\n\\n- **9.20** In adults with type 2 diabetes who have CKD (with confirmed estimated glomerular filtration rate \\\\[eGFR\\\\] of 20–60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 and/or albuminuria), an SGLT2 inhibitor should be used for minimizing progression of CKD, reduction in cardiovascular events, and reduction in hospitalizations for HF ( **[Fig. 9.3](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.3)**); however, the glycemic benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors are reduced at eGFR <45 mL/min per 1.73 m2 (see Section 11, “ [Chronic Kidney Disease and Risk Management](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S011)” for details on renal risk reduction recommendations). **A**\\n\\n- **9.21** In adults with type 2 diabetes and advanced CKD (eGFR <30 mL/min per 1.73 m2), a GLP-1 RA is preferred for glycemic management due to lower risk of hypoglycemia and for cardiovascular event reduction. **B**\\n\\n- **9.22** In adults with type 2 diabetes, initiation of insulin should be considered regardless of background glucose-lowering therapy or disease stage if there is evidence of ongoing catabolism (e.g., unexpected weight loss), if symptoms of hyperglycemia are present, or when A1C or blood glucose levels are very high (i.e., A1C >10% \\\\[>86 mmol/mol\\\\] or blood glucose ≥300 mg/dL \\\\[≥16.7 mmol/L\\\\]). **E**\\n\\n- **9.23** In adults with type 2 diabetes, a GLP-1 RA, including a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 RA, is preferred to insulin ( **[Fig. 9.4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.4)**). **A**\\n\\n- **9.24** If insulin is used, combination therapy with a GLP-1 RA, including a dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, is recommended for greater glycemic effectiveness as well as beneficial effects on weight and hypoglycemia risk for adults with type 2 diabetes. Insulin dosing should be reassessed upon addition or dose escalation of a GLP-1 RA or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA. **A**\\n\\n- **9.25** In adults with type 2 diabetes, glucose-lowering agents may be continued upon initiation of insulin therapy (unless contraindicated or not tolerated) for ongoing glycemic and metabolic benefits (i.e., weight, cardiometabolic, or kidney benefits). **A**\\n\\n- **9.26** To minimize the risk of hypoglycemia and treatment burden when starting insulin therapy in adults with type 2 diabetes, reassess the need for and/or dose of glucose-lowering agents with higher hypoglycemia risk (i.e., sulfonylureas and meglitinides). **A**\\n\\n- **9.27** Monitor for signs of overbasalization during insulin therapy, such as basal dose exceeding ∼0.5 units/kg/day, significant bedtime-to-morning or postprandial-to-preprandial glucose differential, occurrences of hypoglycemia (aware or unaware), and high glycemic variability. When overbasalization is suspected, a thorough reevaluation should occur promptly to further tailor therapy to the individual’s needs. **E**\\n\\n- **9.28** Routinely assess all people with diabetes for financial obstacles that could impede their diabetes management. Clinicians, members of the diabetes care team, and social services professionals should work collaboratively, as appropriate and feasible, to support these individuals by implementing strategies to reduce costs, thereby improving their access to evidence-based care. **E**\\n\\n- **9.29** In adults with diabetes and cost-related barriers, consider use of lower-cost medications for glycemic management (i.e., metformin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, and human insulin) within the context of their risks for hypoglycemia, weight gain, cardiovascular and kidney events, and other adverse effects. **E**\\n\\n\\n#### Figure 9.3.\\n\\nUse of glucose-lowering medications in the management of type 2 diabetes.

Person-specific factors that affect choice of treatment include individualized glycemic goals (see Section 6, “ [Glycemic Goals and Hypoglycemia](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S006)”), individualized weight goals, the individual’s risk for hypoglycemia, and the individual’s history of or risk factors for cardiovascular, kidney, liver, and other comorbidities and complications of diabetes (see Section 4, “ [Comprehensive Medical Evaluation and Assessment of Comorbidities](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S004),” Section 10, “ [Cardiovascular Disease and Risk Management](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S010),” and Section 11 “ [Chronic Kidney Disease and Risk Management](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S011)”). In addition, treatment decisions must consider the tolerability and side effect profiles of medications, complexity of the medication plan and the individual’s capacity to implement it given their specific situation and context, and the access, cost, and availability of medication. Lifestyle modifications and health behaviors that improve health (see Section 5, “ [Facilitating Positive Health Behaviors and Well-being to Improve Health Outcomes](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S005)”) should be emphasized along with any pharmacologic therapy. Section 13, “ [Older Adults](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S013),” and Section 14, “ [Children and Adolescents](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S014),” have recommendations specific for older adults and for children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes, respectively. Section 10, “ [Cardiovascular Disease and Risk Management](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S010),” and Section 11, “ [Chronic Kidney Disease and Risk Management](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S011),” have recommendations for the use of glucose-lowering drugs in the management of cardiovascular disease and kidney disease, respectively.\\n\\n### Choice of Glucose-Lowering Therapy\\n\\nHealthy lifestyle behaviors, diabetes self-management, education, and support, avoidance of clinical inertia, and social determinants of health should be considered in the glucose-lowering management of type 2 diabetes. Pharmacologic therapy should be guided by person-centered treatment factors, including comorbidities and treatment goals and preferences. Pharmacotherapy should be started at the time type 2 diabetes is diagnosed unless there are contraindications. Pharmacologic approaches that provide the efficacy to achieve treatment goals should be considered, such as metformin or other agents, including combination therapy, that provide adequate efficacy to achieve and maintain treatment goals ( [84](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B84)). In adults with type 2 diabetes and established/high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), HF, and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD), the treatment plan should include agents that reduce cardiovascular and kidney disease risk (see **[Fig. 9.3](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.3)**, **[Table 9.2](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T9.2)**, Section 10, “ [Cardiovascular Disease and Risk Management](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S010),” and Section 11, “ [Chronic Kidney Disease and Risk Management](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S011)”). In general, higher-efficacy approaches have greater likelihood of achieving glycemic goals, with the following considered to have very high efficacy for glucose lowering: the GLP-1 RAs dulaglutide (high dose) and semaglutide, the dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 RA tirzepatide, insulin, combination oral therapy, and combination injectable therapy. Weight management is a distinct treatment goal, along with glycemic management, in individuals with type 2 diabetes, as it has multifaceted benefits, including improved glycemic management, reduction in hepatic steatosis, and improvement in cardiovascular risk factors ( [84](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B84)– [86](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B86)). The glucose-lowering treatment plan should therefore consider approaches that support weight management goals, with semaglutide and tirzepatide currently having the highest weight loss efficacy among agents approved for glycemic management ( **[Fig. 9.3](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.3)** and **[Table 9.2](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T9.2)**) ( [84](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B84), [87](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B87), [88](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B88)). Additional weight management approaches, alone or in combination, should be used if needed to achieve individual goals (i.e., intensive behavioral management programs, weight loss pharmacotherapies, or metabolic surgery). See Section 8, “ [Obesity and Weight Management](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S008),” for approaches to achieve weight management goals.\\n\\nMetformin is effective and safe, is inexpensive and widely available, and may reduce risk of cardiovascular events and death ( [89](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B89)). Metformin is available in an immediate-release form for twice-daily dosing or as an extended-release form that can be given once daily. Compared with sulfonylureas, metformin as first-line therapy has beneficial effects on A1C, is weight neutral, does not cause hypoglycemia, and reduces cardiovascular mortality ( [90](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B90)).\\n\\nThe principal side effects of metformin are gastrointestinal intolerance due to bloating, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea; these can be mitigated by gradual dose titration and/or using extended-release formulation. The drug is cleared by renal filtration, and very high circulating levels (e.g., as a result of overdose or acute renal failure) have been associated with lactic acidosis. However, the occurrence of this complication is now known to be very rare, and metformin may be safely used in people with estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2 ( [91](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B91)). A randomized trial confirmed previous observations that metformin use is associated with vitamin B12 deficiency and worsening of symptoms of neuropathy ( [92](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B92)). This is compatible with a report from the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) suggesting periodic testing of vitamin B12 levels ( [93](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B93)) (see Section 3, “ [Prevention or Delay of Diabetes and Associated Comorbidities](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S003)”) in individuals treated with metformin for an extended period of time.\\n\\nWhen A1C is ≥1.5% above the individualized glycemic goal (see Section 6, “ [Glycemic Goals and Hypoglycemia](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S006),” for appropriate goals), many individuals will require dual-combination therapy or a more potent glucose-lowering agent to achieve and maintain their goal A1C level ( [84](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B84), [94](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B94)) ( **[Fig. 9.3](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.3)** and **[Table 9.2](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T9.2)**). Insulin has the advantage of being effective where other agents are not and should be considered as part of any combination medication plan when hyperglycemia is severe, especially if catabolic features (weight loss, hypertriglyceridemia, ketosis) are present. It is common practice to initiate insulin therapy for people who present with blood glucose levels ≥300 mg/dL (≥16.7 mmol/L) or A1C >10% (>86 mmol/mol) or if the individual has symptoms of hyperglycemia (i.e., polyuria or polydipsia) or evidence of catabolism (unexpected weight loss) ( **[Fig. 9.4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.4)**). As glucose toxicity resolves, simplifying the medication plan and/or changing to noninsulin agents is often possible. However, there is evidence that people with poorly managed hyperglycemia associated with type 2 diabetes can also be effectively treated with a sulfonylurea, GLP-1 RA, or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA ( [87](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B87), [88](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B88), [95](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B95)). GLP-1 RAs and tirzepatide have additional benefits over insulin and sulfonylureas, specifically lower risk for hypoglycemia (both) and favorable weight (both), cardiovascular (GLP-1 RAs), and kidney (GLP-1 RAs) end points.\\n\\n### Combination Therapy\\n\\nBecause type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease in many individuals, maintenance of glycemic goals often requires combination therapy. Traditional recommendations have been to use stepwise addition of medications to metformin to maintain goal A1C. The advantage of this is to provide a clear assessment of the positive and negative effects of new drugs and reduce potential side effects and expense ( [96](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B96)). However, there are data to support initial combination therapy for more rapid attainment of glycemic goals ( [97](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B97), [98](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B98)) and later combination therapy for longer durability of glycemic effect ( [99](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B99)). The VERIFY (Vildagliptin Efficacy in combination with metformin For earlY treatment of type 2 diabetes) trial demonstrated that initial combination therapy—in this case of metformin and the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor vildagliptin—is superior to sequential addition of medications for extending primary and secondary failure ( [100](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B100)). Initial combination therapy should be considered in people presenting with A1C levels 1.5–2.0% above goal. Finally, incorporation of high-glycemic-efficacy therapies or therapies for cardiovascular and kidney disease risk reduction (e.g., GLP-1 RAs, dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, and SGLT2 inhibitors) may allow for weaning of the current medication plan, particularly of agents that may increase the risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain. Thus, treatment intensification may not necessarily follow a pure sequential addition of therapy but instead reflect a tailoring of the medication plan in alignment with person-centered treatment goals and pursuit of multifaceted treatment goals ( **[Fig. 9.3](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.3)**).\\n\\nTreatment intensification, deintensification, or modification—as appropriate—for people not meeting individualized treatment goals should not be delayed. Shared decision-making is important in discussions regarding treatment change. The choice of medication added to initial therapy is based on the clinical characteristics of the individual and their preferences and goals for care. Important clinical characteristics include the presence of overweight or obesity, established ASCVD or indicators of high ASCVD risk, HF, CKD, obesity, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, hypoglycemia, and risk for specific adverse drug effects, as well as safety, tolerability, accessibility, usability, and cost. Results from comparative effectiveness meta-analyses suggest that each new class of oral noninsulin agents added to initial therapy with metformin generally lowers A1C approximately 0.7–1.0% (8–11 mmol/mol); if a GLP-1 RA or the dual GIP and GLP-1 RA is added, a 1 to ≥2% lowering in A1C is expected ( [87](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B87), [101](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B101), [102](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B102)) ( **[Fig. 9.3](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.3)** and **[Table 9.2](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T9.2)**).\\n\\nFor people with type 2 diabetes and established ASCVD or indicators of high ASCVD risk, HF, or CKD, an SGLT2 inhibitor and/or GLP-1 RA with demonstrated cardiovascular benefit (see **[Table 9.2](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T9.2)**, **Table 10.3 _B_**, and **Table 10.3 _C_**) is recommended as part of the glucose-lowering plan independent of A1C, independent of metformin use, and in consideration of person-specific factors ( **[Fig. 9.3](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.3)**). Individuals with these comorbidities already achieving their individualized glycemic goals with other medications may benefit from switching to these preferred medications, if possible, to reduce risk of ASCVD, HF, and/or CKD in addition to achieving glycemic goals (see Section 10, “ [Cardiovascular Disease and Risk Management](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S010)” and Section 11, “ [Chronic Kidney Disease and Risk Management](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S011)”). This is particularly important as SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RA are associated with lower risk of hypoglycemia and individuals with ASCVD, HF, and CKD experience heightened hypoglycemia risk.\\n\\nFor people without established ASCVD, indicators of high ASCVD risk, HF, or CKD, medication choice is guided by efficacy in support of individualized glycemic and weight management goals, avoidance of side effects (particularly hypoglycemia and weight gain), cost/access, and individual preferences ( [103](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B103)). A systematic review and network meta-analysis suggests that the greatest reductions in A1C level are with insulin plans, specific GLP-1 RAs (particularly semaglutide), and tirzepatide ( [87](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B87), [88](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B88), [104](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B104)). In all cases, treatment plans need to be continuously reviewed for efficacy, side effects, and burden ( **[Table 9.2](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T9.2)**). In some instances, the individual will require medication reduction or discontinuation. Common reasons for this include ineffectiveness, hypoglycemia, intolerable side effects, new contraindications, expense, or a change in glycemic goals (e.g., in response to development of comorbidities or changes in treatment goals). Section 13, “ [Older Adults](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S013),” has a full discussion of treatment considerations in older adults, in whom changes of glycemic goals and de-escalation of therapy are common.\\n\\nThe need for the greater potency of injectable medications is common, particularly in people with a longer duration of diabetes. The addition of basal insulin, either human NPH or one of the long-acting insulin analogs, to oral agent medication plans is a well-established approach that is effective for many individuals. In addition, evidence supports the utility of GLP-1 RAs in people not attaining their glycemic goals. While most GLP-1 RAs are injectable, an oral formulation of semaglutide is commercially available ( [105](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B105)). In trials comparing the addition of an injectable GLP-1 RA, dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, or insulin in people needing further glucose lowering, glycemic efficacies of injectable GLP-1 RA and dual GIP and GLP-1 RA were similar to or greater than that of basal insulin ( [106](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B106)– [113](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B113)). GLP-1 RAs and dual GIP and GLP-1 RA in these trials had a lower risk of hypoglycemia and beneficial effects on body weight compared with insulin, albeit with greater gastrointestinal side effects. Thus, trial results support high potency GLP-1 RAs and dual GIP and GLP-1 RA as the preferred options for individuals requiring the potency of an injectable therapy for glucose management ( **[Fig. 9.4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.4)**). In individuals who are intensified to insulin therapy, combination therapy with a GLP-1 RA or a dual GIP and GLP-1 RA has been shown to have greater efficacy and durability of glycemic treatment effect, as well as weight and hypoglycemia benefit, than treatment intensification with insulin alone ( [84](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B84), [114](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B114)). However, cost and tolerability issues are important considerations in GLP-1 RA and dual GIP and GLP-1 RA use.\\n\\nCosts for diabetes medications have increased dramatically over the past two decades, and an increasing proportion is now passed on to people with diabetes and their families ( [115](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B115)). **[Table 9.3](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T9.3)** provides cost information for currently approved noninsulin therapies. Of note, prices listed are average wholesale prices (AWP) ( [116](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B116)) and National Average Drug Acquisition Costs (NADAC) ( [117](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B117)), separate measures to allow for a comparison of drug prices, but do not account for discounts, rebates, or other price adjustments often involved in prescription sales that affect the actual cost incurred by the individual. Medication costs can be a major source of stress for people with diabetes and contribute to worse medication-taking behavior ( [118](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B118)); cost-reducing strategies may improve medication-taking behavior in some cases ( [119](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B119)). Although caps on costs are starting to occur for insulin products, no such caps exist for diabetes durable medical equipment or for noninsulin medications. It is therefore essential to screen all people with diabetes for financial concerns and cost-related barriers to care and to engage members of the health care team—including pharmacists, certified diabetes care and education specialists, social workers, community health workers, community paramedics, and others—to identify cost-saving opportunities for medications, diabetes durable medical equipment, and glucagon ( [120](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B120)).\\n\\n#### Table 9.3.\\n\\nMedian monthly (30-day) AWP and NADAC of maximum approved daily dose of noninsulin glucose-lowering agents in the U.S.\\n\\n| Class | Compound(s) | Dosage strength/ product (if applicable) | Median AWP (min, max) [\\\\*](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn5) | Median NADAC (min, max) [\\\\*](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn5) | Maximum approved daily dose [†](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn6) |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| Biguanides | • Metformin | 500 mg (ER) 850 mg (IR) 1,000 mg (IR) 1,000 mg (ER) 500 mg (Sol) | $89 ($45, $6,719) $108 ($5, $189) $87 ($3, $144) $1,884 ($242, $7,214) $405 ($405, $739) | $5 $2 $2 $31 ($31, $226) $535 | 2,000 mg 2,550 mg 2,000 mg 2,000 mg 2,000 mg |\\n| Sulfonylureas (2nd generation) | • Glimepiride • Glipizide • Glyburide | 4 mg 10 mg (IR) 10 mg (XL/ER) 6 mg (micronized) 5 mg | $73 ($72, $198) $72 ($67, $91) $48 ($46, $48) $54 ($48, $71) $82 ($63, $432) | $3 $6 $10 $12 $8 | 8 mg 40 mg 20 mg 12 mg 20 mg |\\n| Thiazolidinedione | • Pioglitazone | 45 mg | $348 ($7, $349) | $4 | 45 mg |\\n| α-Glucosidase inhibitors | • Acarbose • Miglitol | 100 mg 100 mg | $106 ($104, $378) $294 ($241, $346) | $27 NA | 300 mg 300 mg |\\n| Meglitinides | • Nateglinide • Repaglinide | 120 mg 2 mg | $155 $878 ($58, $897) | $27 $31 | 360 mg 16 mg |\\n| DPP-4 inhibitors | • Alogliptin • Linagliptin • Saxagliptin • Sitagliptin | 25 mg 5 mg 5 mg 100 mg | $234 $630 $524 $657 | $161 $504 $466 $525 | 25 mg 5 mg 5 mg 100 mg |\\n| SGLT2 inhibitors | • Canagliflozin • Dapagliflozin • Empagliflozin • Ertugliflozin | 300 mg 10 mg 25 mg 15 mg | $718 $678 $712 $408 | $574 $543 $569 $328 | 300 mg 10 mg 25 mg 15 mg |\\n| GLP-1 RAs | • Dulaglutide | 4.5 mg pen | $1,117 | $895 | 4.5 mg [‡](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn7) |\\n| | • Exenatide | 10 µg pen | $964 | $771 | 20 µg |\\n| | • Exenatide (extended release) | 2 mg pen | $990 | $793 | 2 mg [‡](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn7) |\\n| | • Liraglutide | 1.8 mg pen | $1,340 | $1,072 | 1.8 mg |\\n| | • Semaglutide | 1 mg pen | $1,123 | $903 | 2 mg [‡](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn7) |\\n| | | 14 mg (tablet) | $1,097 ($1,070, $1,123) | $899 | 14 mg |\\n| Dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist | • Tirzepatide | 15 mg pen | $1,228 | $982 | 15 mg [‡](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn7) |\\n| Bile acid sequestrant | • Colesevelam | 625 mg tabs 3.75 g suspension | $711 ($674, $712) $674 ($673, $675) | $64 $130 | 3.75 g 3.75 g |\\n| Dopamine-2 agonist | • Bromocriptine | 0.8 mg | $1,200 | $965 | 4.8 mg |\\n| Amylin mimetic | • Pramlintide | 120 µg pen | $2,866 | NA | 120 µg/injection [§](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn8) |\\n\\n### Cardiovascular Outcomes Trials\\n\\nThere are now multiple large randomized controlled trials reporting statistically significant reductions in cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes treated with an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 RA; see Section 10, “ [Cardiovascular Disease and Risk Management](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S010),” for details. Participants enrolled in many of the cardiovascular outcomes trials had A1C ≥6.5% (≥48 mmol/mol), with more than 70% taking metformin at baseline, with analyses indicating benefit with or without metformin ( [84](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B84)). Thus, a practical extension of these results to clinical practice is to use these medications preferentially in people with type 2 diabetes and established ASCVD or indicators of high ASCVD risk. For these individuals, incorporating one of the SGLT2 inhibitors and/or GLP-1 RAs that have been demonstrated to have cardiovascular disease benefit is recommended (see **[Fig. 9.3](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.3)**, **[Table 9.2](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T9.2)**, and Section 10, “ [Cardiovascular Disease and Risk Management](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S010)”). Emerging data suggest that use of both classes of drugs will provide additional cardiovascular and kidney outcomes benefit; thus, combination therapy with an SGLT2 inhibitor and a GLP-1 RA may be considered to provide the complementary outcomes benefits associated with these classes of medication ( [121](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B121)). In cardiovascular outcomes trials, empagliflozin, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, liraglutide, semaglutide, and dulaglutide all had beneficial effects on indices of CKD, while dedicated renal outcomes studies have demonstrated benefit of specific SGLT2 inhibitors. See Section 11, “ [Chronic Kidney Disease and Risk Management](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S011),” for discussion of how CKD may impact treatment choices. Additional large randomized trials of other agents in these classes are ongoing.\\n\\nIndividuals at low risk for ASCVD may benefit from GLP-1 RA therapy to reduce their risk of future ASCVD events, although the evidence is currently limited. The Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Type 2 Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness Study (GRADE), which was designed to examine the comparative effectiveness of insulin glargine U-100, glimepiride, liraglutide, and sitagliptin in individuals with short duration of diabetes with respect to achieving and maintaining glycemic control, found that individuals treated with liraglutide had a slightly lower risk of cardiovascular disease compared with individuals receiving the other three treatments (hazard ratio 0.7 \\\\[95% CI 0.6–0.9\\\\]), although no significant differences were found for major adverse cardiovascular events, hospitalization for HF, or cardiovascular death ( [122](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B122)).\\n\\n### Insulin Therapy\\n\\nMany adults with type 2 diabetes eventually require and benefit from insulin therapy ( **[Fig. 9.4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.4)**). See the section insulin administration technique, above, for guidance on how to administer insulin safely and effectively. The progressive nature of type 2 diabetes should be regularly and objectively explained to individuals with diabetes, and clinicians should avoid using insulin as a threat or describing it as a sign of personal failure or punishment. Rather, the utility and importance of insulin to maintain glycemic control once progression of the disease overcomes the effect of other agents should be emphasized. Educating and involving people with diabetes in insulin management is beneficial. For example, instruction of individuals with type 2 diabetes initiating insulin in self-titration of insulin doses based on glucose monitoring improves glycemic management ( [123](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B123)). Comprehensive education regarding blood glucose monitoring, nutrition, and the avoidance and appropriate treatment of hypoglycemia are critically important in any individual using insulin.\\n\\n#### Basal Insulin\\n\\nBasal insulin alone is the most convenient initial insulin treatment and can be added to metformin and other noninsulin injectables for individuals with type 2 diabetes. Starting doses can be estimated based on body weight (0.1–0.2 units/kg/day) and the degree of hyperglycemia, with individualized titration over days to weeks as needed. The principal action of basal insulin is to restrain hepatic glucose production and limit hyperglycemia overnight and between meals ( [124](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B124), [125](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B125)). Attainment of fasting glucose goals can be achieved with human NPH insulin or a long-acting insulin analog. In clinical trials, long-acting basal analogs (U-100 glargine or detemir) have been demonstrated to reduce the risk of level 2 hypoglycemia and nocturnal hypoglycemia compared with NPH insulin ( [126](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B126)). Longer-acting basal analogs (U-300 glargine or degludec) convey a lower nocturnal hypoglycemia risk compared with U-100 glargine ( [127](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B127), [128](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B128)). Clinicians should be aware of the potential for overbasalization with insulin therapy. Clinical signals that may prompt evaluation of overbasalization include basal dose greater than ∼0.5 units/kg, high bedtime-to-morning or preprandial-to-postprandial glucose differential (e.g., bedtime-to-morning glucose differential ≥50 mg/dL \\\\[≥2.8 mmol/L\\\\]), hypoglycemia (aware or unaware), and high variability. Indication of overbasalization should prompt reevaluation to further individualize therapy ( [129](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B129)).\\n\\nThe cost of insulin has been rising steadily over the past two decades, at a pace severalfold that of other medical expenditures. This expense contributes significant burden to people with diabetes, as insulin has become a growing “out-of-pocket” cost for people with diabetes, and direct costs contribute to decrease in medication-taking behavior ( [130](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B130)). As of January 2023, the cost of individual insulins was capped for enrollees in Medicare Part D plans ( [131](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B131)), and at least 20 states and the District of Columbia have also capped insulin costs for enrollees in state-sponsored plans and, in select states, for those without insurance. In 2023, the three major U.S. insulin manufacturers also announced plans to reduce insulin prices; some plans go into effect in January 2024, and another has already occurred. The summary of the cost of insulin products in **[Table 9.4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T9.4)** provides a comparison but is not reflective of the Medicare or state-level caps or the recent manufacturer price reductions. However, the information in **[Table 9.4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T9.4)** reflects how the approval of unbranded versions (insulin aspart, lispro, degludec, glargine U-100, and some premixed products), follow-on products (insulin lispro and glargine), and interchangeable biosimilars (insulin glargine) have led to lower costs compared with other products. For some individuals with type 2 diabetes (e.g., individuals with relaxed A1C goals, low rates of hypoglycemia, and prominent insulin resistance as well as those with cost concerns), human insulin (NPH and regular) may be the appropriate choice of therapy, and clinicians should be familiar with its use ( [132](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B132)). Human regular insulin, NPH, and 70/30 NPH/regular products can be purchased for considerably less than the AWP and NADAC prices listed in **[Table 9.4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T9.4)** at select pharmacies. It is important to note that although these caps, price reductions, use of unbranded or biosimilar versions of analogs, or use of human insulins may impact the cost of insulin products, there are no caps on the costs of the other tools individuals with diabetes need for monitoring or treatment (including glucose monitoring supplies \\\\[strips or sensors\\\\], administration tools \\\\[pen needles, syringes, and insulin pumps\\\\], ketone testing supplies, and glucagon). Therefore, routine assessment of financial obstacles that may impact diabetes management is an important component of effective care of people with diabetes. Collaboration between members of the health care team and with social service professionals to identify and implement cost reduction strategies to support and improve access to evidence-based care is important ( [120](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B120), [130](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B130)).\\n\\n##### Table 9.4.\\n\\nMedian cost of insulin products in the U.S. calculated as AWP and NADAC per 1,000 units of specified dosage form/product\\n\\n| Insulins | Compounds | Dosage form/product | Median AWP (min, max) [\\\\*](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn10) | Median NADAC [\\\\*](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn10) |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| Rapid-acting | • Aspart | U-100 vial | $174 [†](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn11) | $139 [†](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn11) |\\n| | | U-100 cartridge | $215 [†](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn11) | $172 [†](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn11) |\\n| | | U-100 prefilled pen | $224 [†](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn11) | $179 [†](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn11) |\\n| | • Aspart (“faster acting product”) | U-100 vial | $347 | $277 |\\n| | | U-100 cartridge | $430 | $344 |\\n| | | U-100 prefilled pen | $447 | $357 |\\n| | • Glulisine | U-100 vial | $341 | $273 |\\n| | | U-100 prefilled pen | $439 | $351 |\\n| | • Inhaled insulin | Inhalation cartridges | $1,503 | NA |\\n| | • Lispro | U-100 vial | $30 [†](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn11) | $24 [†](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn11) |\\n| | | U-100 cartridge | $408 | $326 |\\n| | | U-100 prefilled pen | $127 [†](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn11) | $102 [†](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn11) |\\n| | | U-200 prefilled pen | $424 | $339 |\\n| | • Lispro-aabc | U-100 vial | $330 | $261 |\\n| | | U-100 prefilled pen | $424 | $339 |\\n| | | U-200 prefilled pen | $424 | $338 |\\n| | • Lispro follow-on product | U-100 vial | $118 | $94 |\\n| | | U-100 prefilled pen | $151 | $121 |\\n| Short-acting | • Human regular | U-100 vial | $172 ($165, $178) [‡](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn12) | $137 ($132, $142) [‡](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn12) |\\n| | | U-100 prefilled pen | $208 | $166 |\\n| Intermediate-acting | • Human NPH | U-100 vial | $172 ($165, $178) [‡](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn12) | $137 ($132, $143) [‡](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn12) |\\n| | | U-100 prefilled pen | $208 ($208, $377) | $234 ($166, $303) |\\n| Concentrated human regular insulin | • U-500 human regular insulin | U-500 vial | $178 | $142 |\\n| U-500 prefilled pen | $230 | $184 |\\n| Long-acting | • Detemir | U-100 vial;

If an individual is not already being treated with a GLP-1 RA or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, a GLP-1 RA (either as an individual product or in a fixed-ratio combination with a basal insulin product) or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA should be considered prior to prandial insulin to further address prandial control and to minimize the risks of hypoglycemia and weight gain associated with insulin therapy ( [84](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B84), [114](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B114)). For individuals who advance to prandial insulin, a prandial insulin dose of 4 units or 10% of the amount of basal insulin at the largest meal or the meal with the greatest postprandial excursion is a safe estimate for initiating therapy. The prandial insulin plan can then be intensified based on individual needs ( **[Fig. 9.4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.4)**). Individuals with type 2 diabetes are generally more insulin resistant than those with type 1 diabetes, require higher daily doses (∼1 unit/kg), and have lower rates of hypoglycemia ( [133](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B133)). Titration can be based on home self-monitored blood glucose or CGM. When significant additions to the prandial insulin dose are made, particularly with the evening meal, consideration should be given to decreasing basal insulin. Meta-analyses of trials comparing rapid-acting insulin analogs with human regular insulin in type 2 diabetes have not reported important differences in A1C or hypoglycemia ( [134](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B134), [135](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B135)).\\n\\n#### Concentrated Insulins\\n\\nSeveral concentrated insulin preparations are currently available. U-500 regular insulin is, by definition, five times more concentrated than U-100 regular insulin. U-500 regular insulin has distinct pharmacokinetics with similar onset but a delayed, blunted, and prolonged peak effect and longer duration of action compared with U-100 regular insulin; thus, it has characteristics more like a premixed intermediate-acting (NPH) and regular insulin product and can be used as two or three daily injections ( [136](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B136), [137](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B137)). U-300 glargine and U-200 degludec are three and two times as concentrated as their U-100 formulations, respectively, and allow higher doses of basal insulin administration per volume used. U-300 glargine has a longer duration of action than U-100 glargine but modestly lower efficacy per unit administered ( [138](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B138)– [140](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B140)). The U-200 formulations of insulin degludec, insulin lispro, and insulin lispro-aabc have similar pharmacokinetics to their U-100 counterparts ( [141](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B141)– [143](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B143)). These concentrated preparations may be more convenient (fewer injections to achieve target dose) and comfortable (less volume to inject target dose and/or less injection effort) for individuals and may improve treatment plan engagement in those with insulin resistance who require large doses of insulin. While U-500 regular insulin is available in both prefilled pens and vials, other concentrated insulins are available only in prefilled pens to minimize the risk of dosing errors. If U-500 regular insulin vials are prescribed, the prescription should be accompanied by a prescription for U-500 syringes to minimize the risk of dosing errors.\\n\\n#### Alternative Insulin Routes\\n\\nInsulin is primarily administered via subcutaneous injection or infusion. Administration devices provide some additional variation in the subcutaneous delivery beyond vial versus insulin pen. Those devices include continuous insulin pumps (programmable basal and bolus settings and fixed basal and bolus settings) and bolus-only insulin patch pump. In addition, prandial or correction insulin doses may be administered using inhaled human insulin. Inhaled insulin is available as monomers of regular human insulin; studies in individuals with type 1 diabetes suggest that inhaled insulin has pharmacokinetics similar to RAA ( [7](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B7)). Studies comparing inhaled insulin with injectable insulin have demonstrated its faster onset and shorter duration compared with the RAA insulin lispro, as well as clinically meaningful A1C reductions and weight reductions compared with the RAA insulin aspart over 24 weeks ( [144](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B144)– [146](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B146)). Use of inhaled insulin may result in a decline in lung function (reduced forced expiratory volume in 1 second \\\\[FEV1\\\\]). Inhaled insulin is contraindicated in individuals with chronic lung disease, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and is not recommended in individuals who smoke or who recently stopped smoking. All individuals require spirometry (FEV1) testing to identify potential lung disease prior to and after starting inhaled insulin therapy.\\n\\n### Combination Injectable Therapy\\n\\nIf basal insulin has been titrated to an acceptable fasting blood glucose level (or if the dose is >0.5 units/kg/day with indications of need for other therapy) and A1C remains above goal, consider advancing to combination injectable therapy ( **[Fig. 9.4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.4)**). This approach can use a GLP-1 RA or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA added to basal insulin or multiple doses of insulin ( [114](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B114), [147](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B147)). The combination of basal insulin and GLP-1 RA (administered via separate injections of individual products or single injection of a fixed-ratio product) has potent glucose-lowering actions and less weight gain and hypoglycemia compared with intensified insulin plans ( [148](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B148)). Two different once-daily, fixed dual combination products containing basal insulin plus a GLP-1 RA are available: insulin glargine plus lixisenatide (iGlarLixi) and insulin degludec plus liraglutide (IDegLira). In select individuals with type 2 diabetes, complex insulin plans can also be simplified with fixed-ratio GLP-1 RA-insulin product ( [149](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B149)).\\n\\nIntensification of insulin treatment can be done by adding doses of prandial insulin to basal insulin. Starting with a single prandial dose with the largest meal of the day is simple and effective, and it can be advanced to a plan with multiple prandial doses if necessary ( [150](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B150)). Alternatively, for an individual on basal insulin in whom additional prandial coverage is desired but administering insulin prior to one or more meal(s) is not feasible, the medication plan can be converted to two doses of a premixed insulin. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages. For example, basal-prandial plans offer greater flexibility for individuals who eat on irregular schedules. On the other hand, two doses of premixed insulin is a simple, convenient means of spreading insulin across the day. Moreover, human insulins, separately, self-mixed, or as premixed NPH/regular (70/30) formulations, are less costly alternatives to insulin analogs. **[Figure 9.4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.4)** outlines these options as well as recommendations for further intensification, if needed, to achieve glycemic goals. When initiating intensification of insulin therapy, metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors, and GLP-1 RA (or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA) should be maintained, while sulfonylureas and DPP-4 inhibitors are typically weaned or discontinued. In individuals with suboptimal blood glucose management, especially those requiring large insulin doses, adjunctive use of a thiazolidinedione or an SGLT2 inhibitor may help to improve control and reduce the amount of insulin needed, although potential side effects should be considered. Once a basal-bolus insulin plan is initiated, dose titration is important, with adjustments made in both mealtime and basal insulins based on the blood glucose levels and an understanding of the pharmacodynamic profile of each formulation (also known as pattern control or pattern management). In some people with type 2 diabetes with significant clinical complexity, multimorbidity, and/or treatment burden, it may become necessary to simplify or deintensify complex insulin plans to decrease risk of hypoglycemia and improve quality of life (see Section 13, “ [Older Adults](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S013)”).\\n\\n## Footnotes\\n\\nSuggested citation: American Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee. 9.

For type 2 diabetes, the standard of care emphasizes lifestyle modification, metformin as first-line pharmacotherapy, and individualized escalation to agents such as SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists—especially for those with cardiovascular or renal comorbidities—based on robust clinical trial evidence.\n\nINTRODUCTION: CONTEXT AND SCOPE\nDiabetes mellitus comprises two major forms—type 1 (T1D) and type 2 (T2D)—with distinct pathophysiology but overlapping management principles emphasizing glycemic control to reduce microvascular and macrovascular complications. This synthesis integrates authoritative, recent consensus guidelines and high-level evidence from the American Diabetes Association (ADA), European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), and pivotal clinical trials to identify current gold-standard treatments and management strategies, highlighting efficacy, safety, and patient-centered considerations.\n\nMAIN FINDINGS ORGANIZED BY THEMES\n\nI. TYPE 1 DIABETES: EVIDENCE-BASED MANAGEMENT\n\nA. Insulin Therapy\n- Intensive insulin replacement is essential for all adults with T1D, delivered either as multiple daily injections (MDI) of prandial and basal insulin or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) via pump [ADA 2024; ADA/EASD 2021].\n- Insulin analogs (rapid- and long-acting) are preferred over human insulins due to lower risk of hypoglycemia and greater dosing flexibility [ADA 2024; DCCT trial].\n- Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems and early adoption of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) are recommended to improve glycemic outcomes, minimize hypoglycemia, and enhance quality of life [ADA 2024; ADA/EASD 2021].\n- Regular education on carbohydrate, fat, and protein counting and dynamic insulin dose adjustment is critical [ADA 2024].\n\nB. Adjunctive and Surgical Therapies\n- Non-insulin adjuncts (e.g., pramlintide, SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 RAs) may offer modest benefits but carry specific risks (notably DKA with SGLT2 inhibitors) and are not standard; their use is individualized [ADA 2024].\n- Pancreas or islet transplantation is reserved for select patients with concurrent kidney transplantation or severe glycemic instability [ADA 2024].\n\nC. Hypoglycemia Management\n- Glucagon (preferably formulations not requiring reconstitution) should be prescribed to all individuals on insulin or at high hypoglycemia risk, with education for support persons [ADA 2024].\n\nII. TYPE 2 DIABETES: EVIDENCE-BASED MANAGEMENT\n\nA. Lifestyle Modification and Education\n- Foundational management includes structured diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES), medical nutrition therapy (MNT), physical activity, and behavioral interventions [ADA/EASD 2018, 2022; ADA 2024].\n- Intensive lifestyle interventions can induce remission in early T2D and are cost-effective across health systems [Look AHEAD trial; DiRECT trial].\n\nB. Pharmacologic Therapy: Stepwise, Evidence-Based Escalation\n\n1. First-Line Therapy\n- Metformin is the preferred initial pharmacologic agent due to efficacy, safety, low cost, and potential cardiovascular benefit [ADA/EASD 2018, 2022; ADA 2024].\n- Metformin is weight-neutral, carries minimal hypoglycemia risk, and is suitable unless contraindicated by renal dysfunction (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m^2) [ADA 2024].\n\n2. Second-Line and Combination Therapy: Personalization Based on Comorbidities and Efficacy\n- For patients with established or high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure (HF), or chronic kidney disease (CKD), SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists with proven benefit are recommended, independent of baseline glycemic control or metformin use [ADA/EASD 2022; ADA 2024].\n  - SGLT2 inhibitors (e.g., empagliflozin, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin) have demonstrated reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), HF hospitalization, and renal disease progression [EMPA-REG OUTCOME, CANVAS, DAPA-HF, CREDENCE trials].\n  - GLP-1 RAs (e.g., liraglutide, semaglutide, dulaglutide) reduce MACE and support weight loss [LEADER, SUSTAIN-6, REWIND trials].\n- For those without cardiorenal comorbidities, therapy is individualized considering efficacy, hypoglycemia risk, weight impact, side effect profile, cost, and patient preference [ADA/EASD 2022; ADA 2024].\n- Early combination therapy may be considered for those with A1C ≥1.5% above target to achieve rapid glycemic control [ADA/EASD 2022].\n\n3. Injectable Therapies and Intensification\n- GLP-1 RAs, including dual GIP/GLP-1 RAs (e.g., tirzepatide), are preferred to insulin as first injectable therapy due to superior efficacy in lowering A1C, promoting weight loss, and lower hypoglycemia risk [SURPASS-2 trial; ADA 2024].\n- Basal insulin is reserved for those with catabolic symptoms, severe hyperglycemia (A1C >10% or glucose ≥300 mg/dL), or when other agents are insufficient [ADA/EASD 2022; ADA 2024].\n- Insulin regimens should be titrated and deintensified to minimize hypoglycemia and treatment burden; overbasalization should be avoided [ADA 2024].\n\nC. Weight Management and Obesity Interventions\n- Weight loss is a distinct therapeutic goal; medications with high weight-lowering efficacy (semaglutide, tirzepatide) are prioritized when appropriate [ADA/EASD 2022; ADA 2024].\n- Metabolic (bariatric) surgery is indicated for select patients with obesity and inadequately controlled T2D [ADA/EASD 2018].\n\nD. Cost, Access, and Health Equity\n- Cost-related barriers are recognized as major obstacles; clinicians should screen for financial hardship and consider lower-cost options (e.g., sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, human insulin) when necessary, balancing efficacy and risk [ADA 2024].\n- Access to newer agents is variable globally, and disparities in care are acknowledged [ADA/EASD 2018].\n\nCRITICAL ANALYSIS OF EVIDENCE QUALITY\n\n- The recommendations are grounded in multiple large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses, providing high-level evidence (Grade A) for most major interventions (e.g., DCCT, UKPDS, EMPA-REG OUTCOME, LEADER, SUSTAIN-6, CREDENCE).\n- Consensus statements from ADA/EASD are based on systematic literature reviews, expert panel deliberations, and peer review, ensuring methodological rigor.\n- Some evidence gaps remain for specific populations (e.g., elderly, adolescents with T2D, those with multimorbidity), and for head-to-head comparisons of newer agents.\n- The efficacy of adjunctive non-insulin therapies in T1D is less robust and is not standard of care due to safety concerns (notably DKA risk with SGLT2 inhibitors).\n\nSYNTHESIS OF KEY INSIGHTS AND PATTERNS\n\n- Both T1D and T2D management are increasingly individualized, emphasizing patient-centered care, shared decision-making, and alignment with comorbidities, preferences, and social determinants of health.\n- For T1D, technological advances (CGM, AID systems) are transforming glycemic management and quality of life.\n- For T2D, the paradigm has shifted from a glucose-centric approach to a comprehensive, multifactorial risk reduction strategy, prioritizing agents with proven cardiorenal benefits.\n- Weight management is now a central focus in T2D care, with pharmacologic and surgical interventions integrated into care algorithms.\n- Cost and access remain significant barriers to optimal care, necessitating ongoing advocacy and system-level interventions.\n\nLIMITATIONS AND GAPS IDENTIFIED\n\n- Limited evidence for optimal approaches in older adults, those with frailty, and adolescents with T2D.\n- Gaps in long-term comparative effectiveness of newer agents (e.g., tirzepatide) and in precision medicine approaches.\n- Ongoing uncertainty regarding the additive benefits of combining SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs for cardiorenal protection.\n- Implementation science and real-world effectiveness lag behind clinical trial evidence.\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED CONCLUSIONS\n\n- For T1D, intensive insulin therapy (preferably with analogs), supported by CGM and AID systems, remains the gold standard, with strong evidence for improved glycemic control and reduced complications.\n- For T2D, foundational lifestyle modification and metformin are first-line; SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs are prioritized for patients with cardiorenal comorbidities, with individualized escalation based on efficacy, safety, and patient preference.\n- GLP-1 RAs (and dual GIP/GLP-1 RAs) are preferred over insulin as first injectable therapy in T2D due to superior efficacy and safety profiles.\n- Patient-centered care, regular treatment reevaluation, and addressing cost/access barriers are integral to effective diabetes management.\n\nFUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS\n\n- Comparative effectiveness studies of newer agents and combinations, especially in diverse and high-risk populations.\n- Precision medicine approaches to tailor therapy based on genetic, metabolic, and behavioral phenotypes.\n- Long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness of diabetes technologies in T1D and T2D.\n- Implementation research to bridge the gap between guideline recommendations and real-world practice.\n- Strategies to address health disparities and improve global access to evidence-based therapies.\n\nREFERENCES (SELECTED)\n- American Diabetes Association Standards of Care in Diabetes—2024.

Of 10 participants who completed a follow-up visit on day 180, ​seven were no longer using insulintherapy and two had approximately cut their daily insulin use by around 70%.\\n\\n“\\\\[This\\\\] remarkable data add\\\\[s\\\\] to the growing body of evidence for VX-880 as a potentially curative therapy for type 1 diabetes,” said Carmen Bozic, Vertex’s chief medical officer. The company has now been given regulatory approval to expand enrolment to around 37 patients and is planning pivotal studies to support approval.\\n\\nThe results are remarkable as this phase 1/2 trial involved “naked” cells only, which means they need to be given alongside immunosuppressive therapy. Vertex is also developing a version called VX-264 in which the cells are encapsulated in a protective device designed to protect them from rejection by the immune system. A phase 1/2 trial of VX-264 begun last year.\\n\\nVX-880 (formerly known as STx-02) derives from Vertex’s near-$1 billion acquisition of Semma in 2019, which also brought in the encapsulation technology used in VX-264. Since then, the company has expanded its type 1 diabetes cell therapy platform with the $320 million takeover of rival developer [ViaCyte](https://pharmaphorum.com/news/vertex-buys-diabetes-cell-therapy-rival-viacyte-for-320m) in 2022 and a $780 million manufacturing technology licensing deal with [TreeFrog Therapeutics](https://investors.vrtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vertex-and-treefrog-therapeutics-announce-licensing-agreement) earlier this year.\\n\\nLast year, [CellTrans](https://pharmaphorum.com/news/fda-approves-first-cell-therapy-type-1-diabetes) claimed the first FDA approval for a cell therapy for type 1 diabetes, Lantidra (donislecel) consisting of insulin-producing islet beta cells taken from deceased donors. The therapy, which needs to be given with immunosuppressive drugs, is cleared for use in a group of patients who are particularly hard hit by SHEs.\\n\\nOther companies working in this area include Canadian group Sernova, which has a phase 1/2 trial on the go for islet cells in its proprietary Cell Pouch device. The first patient to receive that therapy has now been insulin-independent for four years with normal-range HbA1c levels, according to a recent company update.\\n\\n_Photo by_ [_Sweet Life_](https://unsplash.com/@sweetlifediabetes?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash) _on_ [_Unsplash_](https://unsplash.com/photos/a-person-injecting-insulin-into-stomach-for-diabetes-management-pMVS9fMtL4Y?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash)\\n\\nImage\\n\\n![Phil Taylor](https://pharmaphorum.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2023-02/Phil-Taylor-126px.jpg?itok=4ZCR7GLo)\\n\\n![profile-mask](https://pharmaphorum.com/themes/custom/pharmaphorum_theme/library/img/Author-Profile-Mask-126px.png)\\n\\n[Phil Taylor](https://pharmaphorum.com/author/phil-taylor)\\n\\n24 June, 2024\\n\\n## [type 1 diabetes](https://pharmaphorum.com/tag/type-1-diabetes)\\n\\n[![Facebook](https://pharmaphorum.com/themes/custom/pharmaphorum_theme/library/img/share-icons/FB-icon-24px.png)](javascript:void(0);)[![X](https://pharmaphorum.com/themes/custom/pharmaphorum_theme/library/img/share-icons/TW-X-icon-24px.png)](javascript:void(0);)[![Linkedin](https://pharmaphorum.com/themes/custom/pharmaphorum_theme/library/img/share-icons/LN-icon-24px.png)](javascript:void(0);)\\n\\n[Bookmark this](https://pharmaphorum.com/flag/flag/bookmark/19345?destination=/news/vertex-islet-cell-therapy-gets-type-1-diabetics-insulin&token=SlRdDfpWHX_IlWpxOjRXVxGC8YbRaHzVQSi3_M5v3mA)\\n\\nOncology\\n\\n![Interview at ASCO 2025 with Dr Jason Williams](https://pharmaphorum.com/sites/default/files/styles/x_large/public/2025-08/ASCO-2025-Dr-Jason-Williams.jpg?itok=CS6gEaGa)\\n\\n### [Exploring the unconventional to provide hope: Dr Jason Willi...](https://pharmaphorum.com/oncology/exploring-unconventional-provide-hope-dr-jason-williams-asco-2025)\\n\\nNews\\n\\n![The new type 1 diabetes Barbie doll](https://pharmaphorum.com/sites/default/files/styles/x_large/public/2025-07/T1D_Barbie_1200x675.jpg?itok=NlMjvqBx)\\n\\n### ['Diabetes Barbie' launches with medtech accessories](https://pharmaphorum.com/news/diabetes-barbie-launches-medtech-accessories)\\n\\nBarbie just took a step forward for inclusivity and representation with the launch of a doll with type 1 diabetes.\\n\\n![/themes/custom/pharmaphorum_theme/library/img/article-label-image/ondemand.png](https://pharmaphorum.com/themes/custom/pharmaphorum_theme/library/img/article-label-image/ondemand.png)\\n\\nMarket Access\\n\\n![Bridging research and clinical guidelines](https://pharmaphorum.com/sites/default/files/styles/x_large/public/2025-04/ALtmetric%20%281%29.jpg?itok=sv12FGpF)\\n\\nSponsored\\n\\n### [Bridging research and clinical guidelines – interactive stra...](https://pharmaphorum.com/market-access/bridging-research-and-clinical-guidelines-interactive-strategies-medical-affairs)\\n\\nMedical affairs is evolving.

Comparatively, the diabetes rates between 1999 and 2000 in the U.S. were significantly lower, at 9.7%. Diabetes is a chronic disease treated in [internal medicine](https://tfscro.com/glossary/internal-medicine/) that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, termed [type 1](https://tfscro.com/glossary/type-1-diabetes/) diabetes, or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces, known as [type 2](https://tfscro.com/glossary/type-2-diabetes-mellitus/) [diabetes mellitus](https://tfscro.com/glossary/type-2-diabetes-mellitus/). Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose, and in uncontrolled diabetes, chronically high blood sugar levels gradually cause serious damage throughout the body, especially the nerves and blood vessels. The damage from diabetes significantly increases the risk of blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke and lower limb amputation.\\n\\nEvery year on November 14, World Diabetes Day provides an opportunity to raise awareness about diabetes as a critical global public health issue and emphasize the need for greater awareness of prevention and management strategies. As World Diabetes Day 2024 draws near, this blog will highlight the 10 most promising clinical trials pushing the boundaries of diabetes treatment and prevention, from innovative therapies and novel drug delivery methods to breakthroughs in [personalized medicine](https://tfscro.com/glossary/personalized-medicine/). Continue reading to explore the latest therapeutic advancements aimed at improving the lives of those affected by diabetes and discover how ongoing [clinical research](https://tfscro.com/glossary/clinical-research/) is shaping a hopeful future in diabetes care.\\n\\n## 1\\\\. [**Phase I**](https://tfscro.com/glossary/phase-i/) **, First-In-Human Study Evaluates Stem Cell Therapy in Type 1 Diabetes**\\n\\n**ClinicalTrials.gov ID:** NCT05210530\\n\\n**Sponsor:** ViaCyte, and CRISPR Therapeutics\\n\\n**Location(s):** Canada\\n\\n**Description:** ViaCyte and CRISPR Therapeutics have collaborated to conduct a clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of a stem cell therapy, named VCTX210, in producing insulin for type 1 diabetes patients. VCTX210 combines pancreatic endoderm cells (PEC210A) which have been genetically modified using CRISPR/Cas9 technology with a perforated device that delivers these PEC210A cells. Other than assessing the safety of this therapy, the trial will determine whether these implanted pancreatic cells can evade immune detection, multiply and differentiate appropriately, and correctly produce insulin to regulate glucose in adults with type 1 diabetes.\\n\\n## 2\\\\. [**Phase IV**](https://tfscro.com/glossary/phase-iv/) **INHALE-3 Study Investigates the Use of Inhaled Insulin for Type 1 Diabetes**\\n\\n**ClinicalTrials.gov ID:** NCT05904743\\n\\n**Sponsor:** MannKind Corporation\\n\\n**Location(s):** U.S.\\n\\n**Description:** In June 2024, positive 17-week data from the INHALE-3 clinical trial were shared at the American Diabetes Association’s (ADA) 84th Scientific Sessions in Orlando. Adults with type 1 diabetes participating in this study were randomized to receive one of the following insulin regimens:\\n\\n- Insulin degludec plus inhaled insulin (Afrezza) combined with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM).\\n- Usual diabetes care, defined as multiple daily injections (MDI), an automated insulin delivery system, (AID) or a pump without automation.\\n\\nMore participants who received inhaled insulin achieved the trial’s glycemic targets, compared to the usual diabetes care group (30% vs. 17%, respectively). Among those with an A1c (i.e., average blood sugar level over the previous 2-3 months) greater than 7% at baseline, 21% of the inhaled insulin group and 0% of the usual care group were able to lower their A1c percentage to under 7% after 17 weeks. Read the full details of these results in [this press release](https://investors.mannkindcorp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/inhale-3-study-reveals-positive-readout-head-head-comparison).\\n\\n## **3\\\\. Early-Phase SECURE-T2D Pivotal Trial Evaluates Automated Insulin Delivery System for Type 2 Diabetes**\\n\\n**ClinicalTrials.gov ID:** NCT05815342\\n\\n**Sponsor:** Insulet Corporation\\n\\n**Location(s):** U.S.\\n\\n**Description:** The latest data from the SECURE-T2D Phase I/ [Phase II](https://tfscro.com/glossary/phase-ii/) trial demonstrated the promise of diabetes management technologies in improving glycemic control and quality of life for people with type 2 diabetes. The Omnipod® 5 AID System is a novel insulin pump that automatically adjusts insulin delivery based on CGM data by responding to glucose levels in real-time, reducing such burden from patients themselves. The device was administered for a duration of 13 weeks, after which it resulted in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels significantly decreasing from a baseline average of 8.2% to 7.4% at the end of the study. Read the full press release [here](https://diabetes.org/newsroom/press-releases/breakthrough-studies-automated-insulin-delivery-and-cgm-type-2-diabetes).\\n\\nNotably, in August 2024, this automated insulin delivery (AID) technology received approval from the U.S. [Food and Drug Administration (FDA)](https://tfscro.com/glossary/food-and-drug-administration-fda/) for use in adults with type 2 diabetes. This is the first AID system approved for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes management. Read more about this approval [here](https://www.endocrinologyadvisor.com/news/fda-clears-automated-insulin-delivery-system-for-people-with-type-2-diabetes/).\\n\\n## **4\\\\. Phase 1/2 FORWARD Study Reveals Promising Stem-Cell Derived Islet Cell Therapy for Type 1 Diabetes**\\n\\n**ClinicalTrials.gov ID:** NCT04786262\\n\\n**Sponsor:** Vertex Pharmaceuticals\\n\\n**Location(s):** U.S., France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, the United Kingdom (U.K.)\\n\\n**Description:** In June 2024, positive new data from the Phase 1/2 FORWARD clinical trial of VX-880, an infused stem cell-derived islet cell therapy, in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) with impaired hypoglycemic awareness and severe hypoglycemic events (SHEs). The islet cells can be found in the pancreas and are normally responsible for producing insulin in the body. Notably, this trial’s population consisted of patients who experienced recurrent [hypoglycemia](https://tfscro.com/glossary/food-and-drug-administration-fda/) episodes, despite receiving appropriate diabetes care. Of the 12 participants for whom new data was available at this time, 11 individuals experienced a reduction in excess insulin at the last study visit (Day 90). During the evaluation period (after Day 90), the occurrence of SHEs was eliminated in all 12 patients. Overall, this clinical trial suggests that stem cell-derived islets regulate blood glucose control as well as natural human islets, making VX-880 a potentially curative therapy for type 1 diabetes.

Artificial Intelligence-Powered Study Enables Personalized Medicine in Type 2 Diabetes Care**\\n\\n**ClinicalTrials.gov ID:** NCT05181449\\n\\n**Sponsor:** The Cleveland Clinic\\n\\n**Location(s):** U.S.\\n\\n**Description:** In 2022, findings from a clinical study driven by artificial intelligence (AI) in type 2 diabetes were presented at the 82nd Scientific Sessions of the ADA, demonstrating how Whole Body Digital Twin™ technology enables personalized medicine in diabetes care. The Whole Body Digital Twin™ is a platform that uses AI to build a dynamic model that represents each individual’s unique metabolism. The tool is trained by data collected on a daily basis from the patient’s wearable sensors, clinical lab results, and self-reported outcomes. Learn more about this AI-powered technology in [this press release](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/twin-health-secures-50m-to-expand-its-groundbreaking-whole-body-digital-twin-technology-and-service-to-reverse-chronic-metabolic-disease-302014250.html).\\n\\nIn its randomized clinical trial, participants with type 2 diabetes were cared for using the Twin Precision Treatment technology (TPT) versus standard of care. The TPT intervention used the Whole Body Digital Twin™ app to provide personalized coaching on nutrition, sleep, activity, and breathing to reduce A1c levels and promote disease remission. At interim analysis after 180 days, 94.9% (189/199) of TPT patients achieved an A1C less than 6.5% on no medications or metformin only, while 83.9% (167/199) achieved clinical diabetes remission. Read the full study results [here](https://diabetes.org/newsroom/artificial-intelligence-offers-significant-rate-remission-type-2-diabetes-compared-to-standard-care). More recently, in December 2023, the creators of the Whole Body Digital Twin™ service, Twin Health, secured US$50 million in funding to expand this technology for the prevention of chronic metabolic diseases.\\n\\n## **6\\\\. Phase I PROVENT Trial Highlights the Potential of a Vaccine for Type 1 Diabetes**\\n\\n**ClinicalTrials.gov ID:** NCT04690426\\n\\n**Sponsor:** Provention Bio\\n\\n**Location(s):** Finland\\n\\n**Description:** Earlier this year in February, Hyöty et al. (2024) reported results from a phase I study that tested the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of PRV-101, a multivalent vaccine that targets coxsackie B viruses (CBVs) associated with type 1 diabetes. Healthy adults were randomized into the trial and received either placebo, low-dose PRV-101, or high-dose PRV-101. Among the 32 participants treated, no serious adverse events or adverse events leading to study treatment discontinuation were observed. Treatment with the PRV-101 vaccine demonstrated sufficient immunogenicity; after 24 weeks of post-dose follow-up, protective titers against all five serotypes were seen in more than 90% of participants in the low- and high-dose groups. These results support further evaluation of PRV-101 as a possible vaccine to eliminate one known trigger for type 1 diabetes. Read more about the PROVENT trial and diabetes-associated CBV [here](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10954874/).\\n\\n## **7\\\\. ZOE METHOD Trial Compared Personalized vs. Generalized Nutrition for Prediabetes**\\n\\n**ClinicalTrials.gov ID:** NCT03222791\\n\\n**Sponsor:** Zoe Global Limited\\n\\n**Location(s):** U.S.\\n\\n**Description:** The results of the ZOE METHOD randomized controlled clinical trial were released in this 2024 publication from Bermingham et al. Nearly 350 adult participants from the U.S. were enrolled and received either a personalized dietary program (PDP) or general advice (control). The effect of both approaches to nutrition on cardiometabolic health, including prediabetes, was then assessed by the study outcomes. After 18 weeks, those within the PDP regimen arm saw significant improvements in their triglyceride levels, relative to baseline measurements, as well as in secondary outcomes such as body weight, waist circumference, HbA1c, diet quality, and microbiome. These results suggest that, rather than opting for a one-size-fits-all approach to nutrition in diabetes care, adopting a personalized approach may be more effective for treating prediabetes and type 2 diabetes indirectly by improving weight and cardiometabolic health.\\n\\n## **8\\\\. Tirzepatide Significantly Reduces Risk of Type 2 Diabetes in SURMOUNT-1 Trial**\\n\\n**ClinicalTrials.gov ID:** NCT04184622\\n\\n**Sponsor:** Eli Lilly and Company\\n\\n**Location(s):** U.S., China, India, Japan, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Russian Federation, Taiwan\\n\\n**Description:** In August 2024, Eli Lilly and Company shared positive topline results from their Phase III SURMOUNT-1 clinical trial, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide over 176 weeks in adults with prediabetes and obesity. The trial results showed that weekly tirzepatide injections (at doses of 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg) significantly reduced the risk of progression to type 2 diabetes by 94% among adults with prediabetes and obesity or excessive weight compared to placebo. The treatment also resulted in noticeable weight loss during the study period, with patients who received 15 mg tirzepatide experiencing a 22.9% average decrease in body weight compared to 2.1% in the placebo group. By the 17-week off-treatment follow-up period, patients in the experimental arm overall had an 88% reduction in the risk of progression to type 2 diabetes compared to placebo. These latest results from the SURMOUNT-1 demonstrate the strong potential of tirzepatide to act as an effective intervention for patients with prediabetes.\\n\\n## **9\\\\. Dexcom CGM Provides Long-Term Glycemic Improvement in Type 2 Diabetes**\\n\\n**Publication DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.1089/dia.2024.0197](https://doi.org/10.1089/dia.2024.0197)\\n\\n**Sponsor:** Dexcom, CGParkin Communications, International Diabetes Center\\n\\n**Location(s):** U.S.\\n\\n**Description:** At this year’s ADA Scientific Sessions, DexCom revealed additional clinical data from several studies on their Dexcom CGM, a real-time CGM device for those with type 2 diabetes. Among the data presented, [this real-world study](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/dia.2024.0197) demonstrated the benefits of this CGM device in patients with sub-optimally controlled non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetes, reporting improvements in A1C independent of anti-diabetes medication. Dexcom CGM was associated with increased time in range (TIR), a glycemic metric that represents how long a patient is within an appropriate blood sugar range. At 12 months, the proportion of CGM users who met the target TIR of >70% increased from 0% to 43.9% in the <65 years old cohort and from 0% to 37.4% in the ≥65 years old cohort ( _P_ = 0.008). Therefore, real-world data (RWD) on Dexcom CGM suggests the device provides long-term glycemic improvements in patients with non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetes.\\n\\nAnother study also reported that Dexcom CGM may be a valuable diabetes prevention tool for individuals with prediabetes by promoting healthy lifestyle changes. It reported that CGM use was associated with improvements in nutrition habits, physical activity, weight, blood pressure, worry, energy levels, and healthcare provider interactions. Read more about the latest clinical findings for Dexcom CGM from ADA 2024 [here](https://investors.dexcom.com/news/news-details/2024/Dexcom-Showcases-Extensive-Clinical-Data-at-ADA-2024-Demonstrating-the-Benefit-of-Dexcom-CGM-Use-Among-People-With-Type-2-Diabetes/default.aspx).\\n\\n## **10\\\\. Investigator-Initiated Trial Successfully Prevents Islet Transplant Rejection in Adults with Type 1 Diabetes**\\n\\n**ClinicalTrials.gov ID:** NCT06305286\\n\\n**Sponsor:** University of Chicago, Eledon Pharmaceuticals\\n\\n**Location(s):** U.S.\\n\\n**Description:** In October 2024, researchers from the University of Chicago Medicine Transplant Institute announced potentially the first human cases of insulin independence and glucose control in islet transplant recipients with type 1 diabetes. The three patients were treated with tegoprubart, an anti-CD40L monoclonal antibody. The first two islet transplant recipients achieved insulin independence and normal blood glucose control post-transplant. The third subject had only recently received an islet transplant, but tegoprubart successfully decreased insulin use by more than 60% within three days post-procedure, suggesting they will also eventually reach insulin independence.\\n\\nType 1 diabetes is characterized as an autoimmune condition in which patients lose their ability to produce insulin effectively because the pancreatic islet cells have been abnormally targeted by the immune system. Pancreatic islet transplantation involves engraftment with insulin-producing beta cells isolated from the pancreas of another human donor. Following the transplant, patients with type 1 diabetes can theoretically produce insulin on their own without the need for insulin injections, but only if the foreign islet cells are not rejected. This is where immunosuppression treatment with tegoprubart is necessary because it prevents transplant rejection, allowing the patient to achieve insulin freedom. The first islet cell therapy, Lantidra, was approved by the U.S. FDA only recently in 2023, meaning more studies are needed before this rare form of therapy for type 1 diabetes can become more widespread.\\n\\n## **Conclusion**\\n\\nIn conclusion, the ten innovative clinical trials we have spotlighted here represent cutting edge research taking place in internal medicine and diabetes care in 2024. Although several are still ongoing and the full impact of these novel therapies are not yet seen, they do demonstrate how rapidly new treatment options and even potential curative therapies for diabetes are emerging.

The evidence, drawn from recent clinical trial data and expert overviews, points to a rapidly evolving field with several interventions demonstrating the potential for disease modification or even functional cures, particularly for type 1 diabetes.\n\n---\n\n## Introduction: Context and Scope  \nDiabetes remains a major global health concern, with prevalence rising to nearly 16% among U.S. adults as of late 2024 (TFS HealthScience, 2024). Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes continue to drive research into new treatments, with recent years witnessing a surge in experimental therapies, clinical trials, and technology-enabled care. This synthesis focuses on the most promising experimental treatments and recent breakthroughs in diabetes care, based on the latest clinical trial results, new medications, and technological innovations reported in 2023–2024.\n\n---\n\n## Main Findings by Theme\n\n### 1. **Cell Therapy and Islet Transplantation for Type 1 Diabetes**\n- **Vertex VX-880 Islet Cell Therapy**:  \n  - In a phase 1/2 trial, three participants with type 1 diabetes became insulin-independent within a year after receiving VX-880, a stem cell-derived islet cell therapy (Pharmaphorum, 2024; TFS HealthScience, 2024).\n  - The therapy restored endogenous insulin production and glucose control, with all 12 full-dose recipients showing insulin production and 11 reducing or eliminating exogenous insulin use.\n  - The trial population included high-risk patients with impaired hypoglycemia awareness and severe hypoglycemic events (SHEs).\n  - VX-880 requires immunosuppression; a next-generation encapsulated version (VX-264) is in early-stage trials, aiming to eliminate the need for immunosuppression.\n- **Other Cell-Based Approaches**:  \n  - **VCTX210 (ViaCyte/CRISPR Therapeutics)**: First-in-human trial (NCT05210530) is testing gene-edited, stem cell-derived pancreatic cells delivered in a device designed to evade immune detection (TFS HealthScience, 2024).\n  - **Lantidra (CellTrans)**: First FDA-approved islet cell therapy (2023), using donor-derived beta cells, requires immunosuppression, and is indicated for patients with severe hypoglycemia.\n  - **Sernova Cell Pouch**: Device-based islet transplantation, with one patient insulin-independent for four years.\n\n- **Immunomodulation in Islet Transplantation**:  \n  - Tegoprubart (anti-CD40L monoclonal antibody) enabled insulin independence and glucose control in islet transplant recipients, preventing rejection without standard immunosuppressive regimens (NCT06305286).\n\n### 2. **Novel Drug Delivery and Pharmacological Interventions**\n- **Inhaled Insulin (Afrezza, INHALE-3 Trial)**:  \n  - Phase IV data show that inhaled insulin combined with insulin degludec and CGM led to improved glycemic targets compared to standard care in type 1 diabetes (NCT05904743).\n- **Tirzepatide (SURMOUNT-1 Trial, Eli Lilly)**:  \n  - Weekly injections in adults with prediabetes and obesity reduced progression to type 2 diabetes by 94% and achieved significant weight loss (NCT04184622).\n- **Vaccine Development (PRV-101, Provention Bio)**:  \n  - Phase I trial showed safety and immunogenicity for a coxsackie B virus vaccine, a potential preventive strategy for type 1 diabetes (NCT04690426).\n\n### 3. **Digital and Technology-Enabled Diabetes Management**\n- **Automated Insulin Delivery (Omnipod 5, SECURE-T2D Trial)**:  \n  - First FDA-cleared AID system for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, showing significant HbA1c reduction in type 2 diabetes (NCT05815342).\n- **Continuous Glucose Monitoring (Dexcom CGM)**:  \n  - Real-world data demonstrate improved glycemic control and increased time in range for non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetes, with additional benefits in prediabetes management.\n- **AI-Powered Personalized Medicine (Whole Body Digital Twin™)**:  \n  - Clinical trial using AI-driven individualized coaching led to high rates of diabetes remission and A1c reduction in type 2 diabetes (NCT05181449).\n\n### 4. **Lifestyle and Nutrition Interventions**\n- **Personalized Nutrition (ZOE METHOD Trial)**:  \n  - Personalized dietary programs outperformed general advice in improving metabolic health and prediabetes outcomes (NCT03222791).\n\n---\n\n## Critical Analysis of Evidence Quality\n\n- **Source Credibility**:  \n  - Both Pharmaphorum and TFS HealthScience are reputable sources, with TFS providing detailed clinical trial identifiers and links to primary data.\n- **Evidence Maturity**:  \n  - Many breakthroughs are in phase 1/2 or early pivotal trials; results are promising but require confirmation in larger, longer-term studies.\n  - FDA approvals (e.g., Lantidra, Omnipod 5) indicate regulatory confidence in safety and efficacy for specific populations.\n- **Limitations**:  \n  - Cell therapies often require immunosuppression, limiting broad applicability until encapsulation or immune-evasion strategies mature.\n  - Some interventions (e.g., vaccines, AI platforms) remain in early development or are not yet widely accessible.\n- **Contradictory/Uncertain Evidence**:  \n  - Not all patients achieve insulin independence with cell therapies; long-term durability and safety remain under study.\n  - The scalability and cost-effectiveness of advanced technologies (e.g., digital twins, CGM in non-insulin users) are still being evaluated.\n\n---\n\n## Synthesis of Key Insights and Patterns\n\n- **Shift Toward Disease Modification and Functional Cure**:  \n  - Cell therapies and immunomodulation are moving the field beyond symptom control toward potential cures for type 1 diabetes.\n- **Personalization and Technology Integration**:  \n  - Digital tools, AI, and personalized nutrition are increasingly central to diabetes management, especially in type 2 and prediabetes.\n- **Prevention and Early Intervention**:  \n  - Vaccines and pharmacological agents like tirzepatide are targeting diabetes prevention and early-stage disease.\n- **Regulatory Progress**:  \n  - The FDA has shown willingness to approve novel therapies and devices, expediting access to innovative treatments.\n\n---\n\n## Limitations and Gaps\n\n- **Long-Term Outcomes**:  \n  - Data on durability, safety, and real-world effectiveness of many new interventions are limited.\n- **Accessibility and Cost**:  \n  - High costs and specialized infrastructure may limit widespread adoption of cell therapies and advanced technologies.\n- **Immunosuppression Risks**:  \n  - Most cell-based approaches still require immunosuppression, posing risks and limiting eligibility.\n- **Diversity of Study Populations**:  \n  - Many trials focus on select, high-risk populations; broader generalizability remains to be established.\n\n---\n\n## Evidence-Based Conclusions\n\n- **Cell and islet therapies represent the most promising route toward a functional cure for type 1 diabetes, with early-phase trials demonstrating insulin independence in select patients.**\n- **Technology-enabled interventions (AID systems, CGM, AI-driven care) are improving glycemic control and quality of life, now extending benefits to type 2 diabetes and prediabetes.**\n- **Pharmacological advances (e.g., tirzepatide) and preventive strategies (e.g., vaccines) are expanding the therapeutic arsenal for diabetes prevention and management.**\n- **Despite substantial progress, long-term data, broader accessibility, and solutions to immunosuppression remain critical challenges.**\n\n---\n\n## Future Research Directions\n\n- **Larger, longer-term trials of cell therapies to assess durability, safety, and cost-effectiveness.**\n- **Development and validation of encapsulation or immune-evasion strategies to eliminate the need for immunosuppression.**\n- **Expansion of digital and AI-powered platforms to diverse, real-world populations and healthcare settings.**\n- **Comparative effectiveness studies of new pharmacological and device-based interventions against standard care.**\n- **Research into scalable, population-level prevention strategies, including vaccines and lifestyle interventions.**\n\n---\n\n**References**  \n- Pharmaphorum.

The pathophysiology of youth-onset T2D, although not fully elucidated, is like that of adult-onset T2D, with insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion contributing to hyperglycemia development. Specific abnormalities include increased hepatic, adipose, and skeletal muscle insulin resistance; relative insulin deficiency due to impaired pancreatic beta (β)-cell function; and also, hyperglucagonemia due to alpha (α)-cell dysfunction \\\\[ [1](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B1)\\\\]. The following observations support a conclusion that youth-onset T2D is a more severe and progressive condition than adult-onset T2D. See [Table 1](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T1).\\n\\n### Table 1.\\n\\nUnique characteristics of youth with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and T2D, as compared to adults\\n\\n- A more rapid decline in β-cell function not attenuated by metformin or glargine \\\\[ [2](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B2)– [4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B4)\\\\]\\n\\n- Greater insulin resistance, with significant reductions in insulin sensitivity not explained by race/ethnicity, sex, or body mass index (BMI) \\\\[ [2](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B2)– [4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B4)\\\\]\\n\\n- A relative hyperresponsiveness of pancreatic β-cells resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin secretion at similar glucose concentrations even after adjustments for insulin sensitivity \\\\[ [5](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B5), [6](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B6)\\\\]\\n\\n- Poorer response to diabetes medications \\\\[ [7](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B7)\\\\]\\n\\n- A more rapid development of diabetes complications \\\\[ [8](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B8)\\\\]\\n\\n- Prediabetes and T2D predominance in females compared to males \\\\[ [9](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B9)\\\\].\\n\\n\\nThe risk factors \\\\[ [9](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B9)– [17](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B17)\\\\] (see [Table 2](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T2)) and the clinical correlates of youth-onset T2D underlie recommended risk-based screening approaches. Whilst obesity is a major risk factor by increasing insulin resistance, it is important to note it is not a universal phenotype in youth-onset T2D. The prevalence of obesity as defined by BMI, is lower in Asian children with T2D than in other ethnicities \\\\[ [12](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B12)\\\\] and notably, in Japanese children with a healthy weight, nonautoimmune T2D phenotype, insulin resistance is mild but coupled with a significantly reduced insulin secretory capacity \\\\[ [18](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B18), [19](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B19)\\\\].

As such, early detection and intervention of T2D is likely associated with better outcomes. Universal screening of unhealthy weight youth, in the absence of additional risk factors for T2D, is unlikely to be cost-effective \\\\[ [30](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B30)\\\\] and is not recommended \\\\[ [31](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B31)\\\\].\\n\\n### Diagnosis of Prediabetes\\n\\nPrediabetes indicates that dysglycemia is present, but criteria are not met for diabetes.

Prediabetes has been used to recognize the high risk for progression to T2D \\\\[ [33](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B33)\\\\]. However, none of the diagnostic criteria for prediabetes have been specifically validated in youth, rather all are extrapolated from adult definitions \\\\[ [34](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B34)\\\\] ( [Table 3](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T3) **)**. Recent data suggest a 1-h plasma glucose of >155 mg/dL (8.6 mmol/L) may also indicate an increased risk to progress to T2D \\\\[ [35](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B35)\\\\].\\n\\n#### Table 3.\\n\\nRecommended criteria for the diagnosis of prediabetes \\\\[B\\\\]\\n\\n| Test | Laboratory values |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (indicates IFG) | ADA IFG definition: 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L) |\\n| NICE/IEC/WHO/DC IFG definition: 110–125 mg/dL (6.1–6.9 mmol/L) |\\n| 2-h plasma glucose (indicates IGT) | >140–199 mg/dL (7.8–11.0 mmol/L) after an OGTT (after 1.75 g/kg (max 75 g) anhydrous glucose dissolved in water) |\\n| HbA1c | ADA definition: A1c 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol) |\\n| NICE/IEC/DC definition: 6.0–6.4% (42–47 mmol/L) |\\n\\nIndividuals with IGT may manifest hyperglycemia only when challenged with a substantive glucose load and be predominantly euglycemic with normal or near-normal hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels. At the population level, a small percentage of optimal weight youth have elevated HbA1c and/or fasting glucose concentrations suggesting these adult criteria for prediabetes should be applied with caution especially around puberty \\\\[ [36](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B36)\\\\]. There are notable racial differences for meeting prediabetes criteria using HbA1c cut-points alone with Black youth having the highest risk for overdiagnosis of prediabetes based on HbA1c \\\\[ [37](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B37), [38](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B38)\\\\].\\n\\nLimited longitudinal data are available on the natural history and rate of progression of prediabetes to T2D. A Cochrane database systematic review showed a wide pooled cumulative incidence of T2D in youth, usually associated with IGT at baseline and with follow-up of 1–10 years, of 1%–56% \\\\[ [39](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B39)\\\\]. Pubertal insulin resistance may be associated with dysglycemia with a high rate of return to normoglycemia when insulin sensitivity improves \\\\[ [40](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B40)\\\\]. In 547 youth with overweight and obesity aged 14.5 ± 2.2 years (70% Hispanic) with baseline HbA1cs in the prediabetes range, 76% had a follow-up HbA1c (12–22 months later) \\\\[ [40](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B40)\\\\]. Progression to T2D as indicated by HbA1c was 4% in those with baseline HbA1c 5.7%–5.9% and 8% in youth with a baseline HbA1c 6.0–6.4% \\\\[ [41](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B41)\\\\]. Overall, youth with HbA1c in the prediabetes range have low short-term rates of progression to T2D \\\\[ [42](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B42), [43](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B43)\\\\].\\n\\nLifestyle change, with decreased caloric intake and increased physical activity, may be effective for improving insulin sensitivity and glucose lowering in youth with prediabetes \\\\[ [44](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B44)– [46](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B46)\\\\]. However, there are currently insufficient data to support the metformin, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) and/or insulin use to prevent the progression of prediabetes in youth \\\\[ [47](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B47)\\\\].\\n\\n### Diagnosis of T2D\\n\\nRecommended criteria for the diagnosis of T2D: symptoms of hyperglycemia and ONE of the following laboratory values **\\\\[B\\\\]**.\\n\\n- HbA1c ≥6.5% (48 mmol/mol)\\n\\n- FPG ≥126 mg/dL (7.0 mmoL/L)\\n\\n- Random plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L)\\n\\n- 2-h plasma glucose on an OGTT ≥200 mg/dL (11.1 mmoL/L). OGTT: 1.75 g/kg (max 75 g) anhydrous glucose dissolved in water.\\n\\n\\nWhen measuring HbA1c utilize a laboratory based, Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) aligned, National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) certified method **\\\\[B\\\\]**.\\n\\nIn the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia symptoms (including polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia, unexplained weight loss and general fatigue), utilize TWO of the criteria above or confirmatory testing on a different day.\\n\\nThe following support the diagnosis of T2D **\\\\[B\\\\]**.\\n\\n- BMI ≥85th percentile\\n\\n- Signs of insulin resistance\\n\\n- Associated metabolic comorbidities (dyslipidemia, MASLD, hypertension, PCOS)\\n\\n- Family history of T2D\\n\\n- Negative (absent) pancreatic autoantibodies.\\n\\n\\nThe presentation of youth-onset T2D ranges from asymptomatic (detected during routine screening), to symptomatic hyperglycemia, to metabolic decompensation (diabetes ketoacidosis \\\\[DKA\\\\] or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state \\\\[HHS\\\\]) \\\\[ [48](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B48)\\\\]. HHS is significantly more common in youth with T2D than type 1 diabetes (T1D) and is associated with greater morbidity and mortality than DKA \\\\[ [49](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B49)\\\\]. Thus, it is critical to measure serum osmolality in those with metabolic decompensation and suspected T2D.\\n\\nDiagnostic testing encompasses fasting glucose, 2-h/random plasma glucose, and HbA1c, all of which assess glycemia. The OGTT often has poor reproducibility when repeated in the same individual \\\\[ [50](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B50)\\\\] and the HbA1c is often more practical to obtain and correlates well with both fasting and 2-h glucose \\\\[ [51](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B51)\\\\]. These have led the ADA to move the HbA1c to the top of the diagnostic testing hierarchy \\\\[ [52](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B52)\\\\]. HbA1c is unreliable in patients with hemoglobinopathies, within 3 months of transfusion or with increased red cell turnover.\\n\\nPancreatic autoantibodies are recommended in the evaluation of youth-onset T2D. Testing should include glutamic acid decarboxylase-65 (GAD-65), islet antigen-2 (IA-2), zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8) and insulin antibody (IAA), the latter in those who have not yet been treated with insulin. If all four antibodies are unavailable, GAD should be the primary antibody measured and if negative should be followed by IA-2 and/or ZnT8. Immunoassay and the gold-standard radio-binding assays should be used to measure pancreatic autoantibodies. Though immunofluorescence assays may still be available, they are not recommended due to low sensitivity and specificity \\\\[ [53](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B53)\\\\].\\n\\nUp to 12% of youth with clinical diagnosis of T2D can have pancreatic autoimmunity \\\\[ [54](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B54)\\\\]. Youth with a clinical phenotype of T2D and single antibody positivity (sometimes referred to as “double-diabetes” or “double-diabetes”) have been shown to have early insulin requirement \\\\[ [54](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B54)– [56](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B56)\\\\], although data regarding the clinical course and most ideal treatment in patients with diagnosed diabetes and single antibody positivity are limited. When pancreatic autoantibodies are not available, family history, response to treatment, clinical progression and associated metabolic comorbidities can help confirm a T2D diagnosis.\\n\\n### Differential Diagnoses\\n\\n#### Type 1 Diabetes\\n\\nThe diagnosis of T1D should be considered in youth with diabetes with the following clinical features: **\\\\[B\\\\]**\\n\\n- BMI <85th percentile\\n\\n- Age of diabetes onset of <10 years of age\\n\\n- Pre-pubertal at diabetes onset\\n\\n- Absence of risk factors and clinical features of T2D\\n\\n- DKA or cerebral edema at presentation.\\n\\n\\nAlthough the incidence of T2D is increasing worldwide, T1D remains most common type of diabetes in youth \\\\[ [57](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B57)\\\\]. Moreover, obesity is common in most of the westernized world and equally affects those with T1D \\\\[ [58](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B58)\\\\]. Thus, careful consideration of risk factors, including that T2D rarely presents prior to pubertal onset, and further testing for pancreatic autoantibodies helps differentiate between T1D and T2D. [Figure 1](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F1) can be used to assist in determination of initial diagnosis of diabetes type.\\n\\n##### Fig. 1.\\n\\nDiagnosis of new onset diabetes in youth.\\n\\n#### Monogenic Diabetes\\n\\nThe diagnosis of maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) should be considered in youth with the following clinical features: **\\\\[B\\\\]**\\n\\n- BMI <85th percentile\\n\\n- Family history of diabetes in one parent and first-degree relatives of that affected parent\\n\\n- Absence of other risk factors and clinical features of T2D\\n\\n- Absence of pancreatic autoantibodies\\n\\n- Features such as genitourinary tract abnormalities, renal cysts, pancreatic atrophy, hyperuricemia or gout (HNF1B MODY)\\n\\n- Stable isolated fasting hyperglycemia in the range of 100–150 mg/dL (5.5–8.5 mmol/L) (GCK MODY)\\n\\n- History of neonatal diabetes.\\n\\n\\nMonogenic diabetes, diagnosed by genetic testing, is much less common than T1D or T2D \\\\[ [59](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B59)\\\\]. However, it is likely underdiagnosed and because it often is associated with milder hyperglycemia and is familial in nature, may be misdiagnosed as T2D, particularly in youth who otherwise fit the clinical picture of T2D. The ProDiGY collaboration, which includes over 3,000 youth with presumed T2D (including participants from the TODAY and SEARCH studies), found a 2.8% frequency of MODY-positive genetic testing \\\\[ [60](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B60)\\\\]. Monogenic diabetes is important to differentiate from other types of diabetes due to differences in treatment and expected clinical course. The diagnosis should be made more easily now that genetic testing is more readily available and the price has decreased. Tools, such as the MODY calculator \\\\[ [61](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B61)\\\\], can be useful in assessing risk, but require validation across populations and age groups.\\n\\n## Management\\n\\nDiabetes education should be started at the time of diagnosis and as part of ongoing management and should be focused on lifestyle changes ( [Table 4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T4)), medications, and self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) if applicable \\\\[ [62](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B62), [63](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B63)\\\\]. Education materials should be age and culturally appropriate, focused on educating both the youth and their families, and including extended family members if possible.\\n\\n### Table 4.\\n\\nLifestyle recommendations for youth with T2D\\n\\n| Diabetes education should be started at the time of diagnosis and should focus on the following |\\n| --- |\\n| Promotion of a healthy diet - Use culturally sensitive and family-centered approaches to healthy eating **\\\\[B\\\\]** - Teach families and the person with diabetes to interpret nutrition fact labels **\\\\[B\\\\]** - Promote parental modeling of healthy eating habits, while avoiding overly restricted food intake **\\\\[E\\\\]** - Reduce or eliminate all high calorie drinks and replace with water or calorie-free beverages **\\\\[C\\\\]** - Promote meals eaten on schedule, in one place, preferably as a family unit, and with no other activity (television, computer, studying), and minimizing frequent snacking **\\\\[E\\\\]** - Decrease portion sizes **\\\\[B\\\\]** - Encourage vegetable and fiber intake to improve satiety **\\\\[B\\\\]** - Choose roasted, grilled, boiled, or baked over fried foods **\\\\[E\\\\]** - Limit high fat and high calorie food, processed food, and pre-packaged food **\\\\[B\\\\]** - Maintain food and activity logs as beneficial for raising awareness of food and activity issues and for monitoring progress **\\\\[E\\\\]** |\\n| Increasing physical activity and limiting sedentary time - Encourage youth to build up to 60 min of moderate to vigorous physical activity daily with muscle and bone strength training at least 3 days per week **\\\\[B\\\\]** - Reduce sedentary time, including screen-time, computer-related activities, texting, and video games to less than 2 h per day **\\\\[B\\\\]** - Promote physical activity as part of daily living such as using stairs instead of elevators, walking or bicycling to school and to shops, and doing house and yard work **\\\\[E\\\\]** - Encourage positive reinforcement of all achievements and avoidance of shaming **\\\\[E\\\\]** - Encourage exercise as part of family-based activities **\\\\[E\\\\]**. |\\n| Optimizing sleep routines - Encourage adequate sleep duration according to age: 9–11 h for children 5–13 years of age and 8–10 h for adolescents and young adults **\\\\[B\\\\]** - Encourage consistent bed and wake up times and avoiding naps **\\\\[E\\\\]** - Reduce use of electronic devices prior to going to sleep **\\\\[E\\\\]**. |\\n| Mitigation of risky behaviors - Assess use of drugs tobacco, alcohol, and vaping and refer to cessation programs if needed **\\\\[E\\\\]** - Assess sexuality, sexual activity and offer pre-conception counseling **\\\\[E\\\\]**. |\\n\\n### Lifestyle Management\\n\\n#### Promotion of a Healthy Diet\\n\\nTo promote healthy parenting practices related to diet and activity, it is essential to involve a nutritionist/dietitian with experience in nutritional management of youth with T2D. Families and the person living with diabetes should be taught to interpret nutrition fact labels and make dietary changes consistent with healthy eating recommendations, including personalized counseling for weight reduction. Additional dietary recommendations are provided in [Table 4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T4) and the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) 2022 Consensus Guidelines Chapter 10 for Nutritional Management in Children and Adolescents with Diabetes \\\\[ [64](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B64)\\\\].\\n\\n#### Increasing Physical Activity and Limiting Sedentary Time\\n\\nExercise is an important part of the diabetes management plan. Regular exercise improves blood glucose levels, reduces cardiovascular risk factors, contributes to weight loss, and improved sense of well-being \\\\[ [65](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B65), [66](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B66)\\\\]. Any behavior change recommendations must establish realistic goals and consider the families’ health beliefs and behaviors \\\\[ [67](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B67)\\\\]. Recommendations are provided in [Table 4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T4) and the ISPAD Guidelines for Exercise in Children with Diabetes \\\\[ [68](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B68)\\\\]. Reducing sedentary time is also an important goal in the management of T2D in youth \\\\[ [69](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B69)\\\\].\\n\\n#### Optimizing Sleep Routines\\n\\nInadequate sleep is associated with insulin resistance in children and adolescents and contributes to the T2D development \\\\[ [70](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B70), [71](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B71)\\\\]. Sleep timing, duration, and quality should be discussed with youth and their families, promoting sleep hygiene \\\\[ [69](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B69), [70](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B70), [72](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B72)\\\\] (see [Table 4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T4)).\\n\\n#### Recognition and Mitigation of Risky Behaviors\\n\\nYouth with T2D should be screened for the use of tobacco, electronic cigarettes, vaping, recreational drugs and alcohol consumption at each visit and counseled against their use by providing resources for support. Sexual history should be obtained and pre-conception counseling should be included for all females of child-bearing potential. It is important to assess exposure to cigarette smoke in the home because of the adverse effects of second hand smoke and to discourage youth from smoking \\\\[ [73](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B73)\\\\]. Deleterious effects of alcohol misuse in the setting of diabetes and risk for fatty liver disease, as well as hypoglycemia should be discussed \\\\[ [74](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B74)\\\\].\\n\\n### Glucose Monitoring and Hypoglycemia\\n\\nGlucose monitoring by SMBG or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is recommended for youth with T2D who\\n\\n- require insulin **\\\\[A\\\\]**\\n\\n- when there are symptoms of hyper- or hypoglycemia **\\\\[A\\\\]**\\n\\n- during acute illness **\\\\[E\\\\]**\\n\\n- when there is suboptimal diabetes management **\\\\[E\\\\]**\\n\\n- when there are changes in treatment regimen **\\\\[E\\\\]**\\n\\n\\nThe choice of blood glucose monitoring device should be made based on an individual’s and family’s circumstances, desires, and needs **\\\\[E\\\\]**.\\n\\nGlucose monitoring should include a combination of fasting and postprandial glucose measurements with a frequency based on the medication(s) used, the HbA1c value, cost, preferences, and available resources.\\n\\nRates of hypoglycemia in youth with T2D on insulin therapy are lower than in youth with T1D with an incidence rate of 9 events per 5.3 patient-years, \\\\[ [75](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B75)\\\\]. Slightly higher rates of hypoglycemia (but no severe hypoglycemia) were reported in youth when sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors in combination with insulin compared to placebo \\\\[ [76](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B76)\\\\]. If insulin is used, monitoring and treatment for hypoglycemia should be taught. Glucagon should not be routinely prescribed unless patient is on short-acting insulin and experiencing recurrent hypoglycemia. Treatment of hypoglycemic episodes in youth with T2D is the same as that for children T1D. See ISPAD Clinical Practice Consensus Guidelines 2022: Assessment and management of hypoglycemia in children and adolescents with diabetes \\\\[ [77](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B77)\\\\].\\n\\nGrowing evidence in adults with T2D supports use of CGM, irrespective of treatment modality \\\\[ [78](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B78)\\\\]. Standardized, single-page glucose reports from CGM devices, such as the ambulatory glucose profile, should be considered as a standard summary. Time in range, glycemic variability (%), glucose management indicator (previously called estimated HbA1c), and estimated glucose average can be used for assessments of glycemic status. Additionally, time below range, time above range (TAR), and time in tight range of glucose values between 70 and 140 mg/dL are useful parameters for the evaluation of medication response. No specific CGM targets have been defined for T2D.\\n\\nA recent study reported that 10-day CGM use did not impact short-term or long-term glycemic levels in youth with T2D; however, most participants reported behavioral changes such as reviewing blood glucoses and increased insulin administration, and overall improved diabetes management and wanted to continue using CGM \\\\[ [79](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B79)\\\\]. A small pilot study using CGM in 15–19-year-old youth with T2D, showed a modest improvement of HbA1c for participants that wore the CGM >85% of the time and who expressed high satisfaction with the CGM device \\\\[ [80](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B80)\\\\].\\n\\n### Glycemic Targets\\n\\n- HbA1c should be measured every 3 months **\\\\[E\\\\]**.\\n\\n- A recommended optimal target for most youth with T2D is HbA1c of <6.5% (48 mmol/L) **\\\\[E\\\\]**.\\n\\n- A higher HbA1c target may be considered <7% (53 mmol/mol) in youth at the initiation of therapy or in instances where the standard target is assessed as being detrimental to the overall well-being of the person with diabetes or their caregivers (i.e., significant hypoglycemia) **\\\\[E\\\\]**.\\n\\n- FPG targets are 70–110 mg/dL (4–6 mmol/L) **\\\\[E\\\\]**.\\n\\n- Postprandial blood glucose targets are 70–140 mg/dL (4–8 mmol/L) **\\\\[E\\\\]**.\\n\\n- If using CGM, align with established CGM targets used for T1D as no targets for T2D have been established (>70% between 3.9 and 10 mmol/L \\\\[70–180 mg/dL\\\\] <4%: <3.9 mmol/L \\\\[70 mg/dL\\\\]) **\\\\[E\\\\]**.\\n\\n\\nGlycemic goals should be individualized. Glycemic status, via a HbA1c concentration, should be measured every 3 months, if possible. A lower HbA1C goal in youth with T2D when compared with those recommended in T1D is justified by a lower risk of hypoglycemia and a higher risk of complications in youth-onset T2D \\\\[ [67](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B67), [81](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B81)\\\\]. An A1C target for youth with T2D is<6.5% \\\\[48 mmol/mol\\\\]) is recommended if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia \\\\[ [82](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B82)\\\\]. A higher target may be considered at initiation of therapy or in instances where the standard target is assessed as being detrimental to the overall well-being of the person with diabetes or their caregivers \\\\[ [83](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B83)\\\\].\\n\\n## Pharmacologic Management\\n\\n### Initial Therapy\\n\\nInitial therapy in youth with T2D ( [Fig. 2](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F2)).\\n\\n- If initial HbA1c <8.5% (69 mmol/mol) – metformin is the treatment of choice together with healthy lifestyle changes **\\\\[A\\\\]**.\\n\\n- In youth with initial HbA1c ≥8.5% (69 mmol/mol) and without ketosis/acidosis, initial management includes basal insulin (starting dose 0.25–0.5 units/kg) along with metformin therapy **\\\\[B\\\\]**.\\n\\n- If DKA/acidosis or HHS is present, both long acting and short-acting insulin should be started initially **\\\\[A\\\\]**.\\n\\n\\nFor youth with stable glycemia, defined as an HbA1c <8.5% (69 mmol/mol) without ketosis or acidosis, metformin is the first-line therapy of choice together with lifestyle recommendations as outlined in [Table 4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T4) \\\\[ [84](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B84), [85](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B85)\\\\]. Half of adolescents with T2D can maintain effective glycemia management through metformin monotherapy and as such is justified for initial therapy \\\\[ [86](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B86)\\\\]. In youth HbA1c ≥8.5% (69 mmol/mol), insulin will be required initially. Metformin should be started concurrently, and the dose titrated to maximum tolerated up to 2,000 mg daily. If ketosis, acidosis and/or HHS are present, IV insulin should be started.\\n\\nVarious indicators can predict loss of glycemic levels on metformin monotherapy, such as reduced insulin secretion, impaired insulin processing (elevated proinsulin/insulin ratio), an increasing proinsulin level overtime. From a clinically useful standpoint, the TODAY study demonstrated that an HbA1c of ≥6.3% after 48 months \\\\[ [82](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B82)\\\\] or a rise in HbA1c of 0.5% predicts loss of optimal glycemic management within a relatively short period of time \\\\[ [87](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B87)\\\\]. Long-term glycemic management is more likely to be achieved when therapy is intensified as needed to maintain the HbA1c target (treat-to-target) rather than waiting for the HbA1c to rise before intensifying therapy (treat-to-failure) \\\\[ [88](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B88)\\\\].\\n\\nShort-acting insulin should be weaned if started as soon as blood glucose values stabilize. The primary adverse effect of short-acting insulin is weight gain and hypoglycemia. Data from the TODAY study indicated that 90% of youth with T2D can be successfully weaned off insulin and managed with metformin alone with attainment of glycemic targets \\\\[ [84](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B84), [85](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B85)\\\\].\\n\\n### Subsequent Therapy (2–3+ Months after Diagnosis)\\n\\n- Maintenance therapy should be guided by an active approach to maintain the HbA1c targets (treat-to-target) **\\\\[E\\\\]**.\\n\\n- If a HbA1c of <6.5% (53 mmol/mol) is not attained, GLP-1 RA and/or SGLT-2 inhibitor medications should be considered \\\\[A\\\\] and customized to the individual T2D youth needs, preferences and access to these agents **\\\\[E\\\\]**.\\n\\n- Significant and sustained increases in HbA1c despite combination therapy will require insulin therapy. Basal insulin should be maximized and short acting add if glycemic targets still not achieved) **\\\\[E\\\\]**.\\n\\n\\nIf after treatment is initiated a HbA1c target of <6.5% (48 mmol/mol) is not attained, addition of a GLP-1 RA or SGLT-2 inhibitor should be considered. See [Figure 2](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F2) and [Table 5](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T5).

A repeat lipid panel should be obtained 4–12 weeks after initiation or following a dose change of a statin. If LDL cholesterol target levels of <100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L) are still not achieved with at least 3 months of consistent use, then the dose may be further increased by one increment (usually 10 mg). Alternatively, a second agent such as ezetimibe, a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, can be added. Side effects of statins include hepatic enzyme elevation and muscle toxicity and should be checked before and 4–12 weeks after initiating a statin. An LDL-C >190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) should prompt suspicion of familial hypercholesterolemia.\\n\\n#### Fig. 4.\\n\\nLipid evaluation and management in youth with T2D.\\n\\n#### Table 7.\\n\\nNutrition management for dyslipidemia \\\\[A\\\\]\\n\\n| |\\n| --- |\\n| For any abnormal lipid values: - Limit total fat to 25–30% of daily caloric intake - Limit saturated fat to <7% of daily caloric intake - Limit cholesterol to <200 mg cholesterol of daily caloric intake - Avoid trans-fat intake. |\\n| For LDL-C levels above optimal: Add the following: - Water-soluble fiber psyllium at a dose of 6 g/day for children 2–12 years of age, and 12 g/day for children ≥12 years of age - Consider plant sterol and stanol ester supplementation up to 2 g/day. |\\n| For triglyceride levels above optimal: Add the following: - Reduce sugar intake - Replace simple carbohydrates with complex carbohydrates - Avoid sugar-sweetened beverages - Increase dietary fish to increase omega-3 fatty acid intake. |\\n\\nInitial management of elevated TG should optimize blood glucose levels and weight, limit dietary simple sugars, [Table 7](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T7), and encourage physical activity \\\\[ [126](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B126)\\\\].

Of note only 9.1% of deaths in youth with T2D had diabetes related factors as the underlying cause, with external factors (injury, assault, motor vehicular accident) being the most common cause of death.\\n\\nHigher rates of mortality have been associated with younger age at diagnosis, with one Australian study reporting a 10 year decrease in age at diagnosis is associated with a 20–30% increased risk of all-cause mortality and a 60% increased risk of cardiovascular disease \\\\[ [217](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B217)\\\\]. Similarly, a meta-analysis of ∼1.3 million youth diagnosed with T2D from 26 observational studies reported for each 1-year increase in age at diagnosis there is a 4% decreased risk of all-cause mortality after controlling for current age \\\\[ [218](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B218)\\\\]. Taken together, these concerning statistics highlight the need to prevent or delay the diagnosis of T2D and reinforce management of comorbidities and complications in youth with T2D.\\n\\n## Summary and Conclusions\\n\\nYouth-onset T2D is a growing public health concern worldwide that presents with unique characteristics, demographics and progression compared to adult-onset T2D. There is a critical need to better understand the unique pathophysiology of T2D in youth and the interplay of genetics, puberty, and the environment. Health care professionals must appreciate the cultural, social, geographic, and economic barriers to implementing behavioral change and lifestyle modification in the life context of the youth and family. Large gaps persist with respect to high-quality evidence for effective interventions to address identification and addressing social determinants of health (SDOH) on youth-onset T2D incidence and outcomes. Evidence now supports the need for a comprehensive research agenda aimed at the individual, organizational, and policy level, focused on the understanding and amelioration of the effects of the SDOH on youth-onset T2D.\\n\\nFor pediatric heath care professionals engaged in the care of T2D youth, evidence is rapidly evolving regarding the optimal diagnosis, management and monitoring of these youth. Ongoing data and experience from clinical trials and care-approaches will not only aid in optimizing glycemic management, but slow condition progression and reduce long-term comorbidities and complications. It is anticipated that these insights will inform personalized, precision medicine-based approaches to implement in an emerging population experiencing unacceptable rates of morbidity and mortality.\\n\\n## Conflict of Interest Statement\\n\\nThere are no conflicts of interest to report.\\n\\n## Funding Sources\\n\\nThe 2024 Consensus guidelines were supported by unrestricted grants from Abbott Diabetes Care, Dexcom, Medtronic and Sanofi.

ADA’s _Standards of Care_ strives to provide up-to-date guidance using the best available evidence rigorously and comprehensively,” said Nuha ElSayed, MD, MMSc, PPC chair.  The committee is a multidisciplinary team of 20 leading U.S. experts in the field of diabetes care and includes physicians, nurse practitioners, certified diabetes care and education specialists, registered dietitians, pharmacists, methodologists, and others with experience in adult and pediatric endocrinology, epidemiology, public health, cardiovascular risk management, microvascular complications, preconception and pregnancy care, weight management, diabetes prevention, behavioral and mental health, inpatient care, and use of technology in diabetes management.Two designated representatives of the American College of Cardiology (ACC) participated in the subcommittee on the \\\"Cardiovascular Disease and Risk Management\\\" section. This section received endorsement from the ACC for the sixth consecutive year. New this year, the ADA garnered the expertise of specialized subject matter experts by adding them as committee members to the subsections on neuropathy, retinopathy, foot care, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Today, the [_Standards of Care in Diabetes—2023_](https://diabetesjournals.org/care/issue/46/Supplement_1) is available online and is published as a supplement to the January 2023 issue of [_Diabetes Care®_](https://diabetesjournals.org/care). The online version will be annotated in real-time with necessary updates if new evidence or regulatory changes merit immediate incorporation through the “living” _Standards of Care_ process. The ADA fosters broad dissemination through a shortened version of the guidelines, known as the [_Abridged Standards of Care_](https://doi.org/10.2337/cd23-as01), for primary care providers in its journal [_Clinical Diabetes_](https://diabetesjournals.org/clinical) ® and offers a convenient [_Standards of Care_  app](https://professional.diabetes.org/content-page/standards-care-app-1) as well as a _Standards of Care_ pocket chart.

Key updates include new diagnostic and treatment algorithms, expanded pharmacologic options—especially for youth-onset Type 2 diabetes—and a strong emphasis on individualized, evidence-based management to reduce complications and improve outcomes. No technical errors or major omissions were found in the tool execution, but the output is heavily weighted toward Type 2 diabetes in youth and does not fully detail Type 1 diabetes treatments or efficacy rates as originally requested.\n\n---\n\n## Introduction: Context and Scope\n\nThis analysis integrates the 2024 ISPAD Clinical Practice Consensus Guidelines for Type 2 Diabetes in Children and Adolescents and the 2023 American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Care. Both are globally recognized, evidence-based sources that guide the prevention, diagnosis, and management of diabetes. The focus is on identifying standard-of-care treatments with the highest efficacy, as supported by recent clinical guidelines and meta-analyses, for both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.\n\n---\n\n## Main Findings by Theme\n\n### 1. Diagnostic Algorithms and Risk Stratification\n\n- **Youth-onset Type 2 Diabetes (T2D):** The ISPAD 2024 guidelines present updated diagnostic algorithms, emphasizing risk-based screening after puberty or age 10, especially in those with BMI ≥85th percentile and additional risk factors (family history, high-risk ethnicity, maternal diabetes, insulin resistance, etc.). Screening tools include HbA1c, fasting glucose, and OGTT (ISPAD 2024).\n- **Type 1 Diabetes (T1D):** Diagnosis relies on clinical presentation, laboratory glucose criteria, and pancreatic autoantibody testing. Differential diagnosis is critical to distinguish T1D from T2D and monogenic diabetes (ISPAD 2024; ADA 2023).\n\n### 2. Lifestyle Management\n\n- **Universal First-line Therapy:** Both guidelines stress the foundational role of medical nutrition therapy, increased physical activity, sleep optimization, and behavioral support for all forms of diabetes (ISPAD 2024; ADA 2023).\n- **Youth-specific Considerations:** Interventions must be culturally sensitive, family-centered, and consider social determinants of health.\n\n### 3. Pharmacologic Management\n\n#### Type 2 Diabetes (especially in youth)\n\n- **First-line:** Metformin remains the first-line pharmacologic therapy for youth-onset T2D with mild hyperglycemia (HbA1c <8.5%) (ISPAD 2024; ADA 2023).\n- **Insulin:** Required at diagnosis if severe hyperglycemia (HbA1c ≥8.5%), ketosis, or acidosis is present.\n- **Second-line/Emerging Agents:** If glycemic targets are not met, GLP-1 receptor agonists (e.g., liraglutide, exenatide, dulaglutide) and SGLT-2 inhibitors (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin) are now approved for youth ≥10 years, based on recent RCTs showing significant HbA1c reduction (typically 0.6–1.5%) and good safety profiles (ISPAD 2024).\n- **Other Agents:** DPP-4 inhibitors and thiazolidinediones (e.g., pioglitazone) have limited pediatric data; sulfonylureas are generally not preferred due to risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain.\n- **Bariatric Surgery:** Considered for youth ≥12 years with severe obesity (BMI ≥35 kg/m²) and T2D refractory to medical therapy.\n\n#### Type 1 Diabetes\n\n- **Insulin Therapy:** Remains the only standard-of-care pharmacologic treatment. Intensive basal-bolus regimens or insulin pump therapy are recommended for optimal glycemic control (ADA 2023; ISPAD 2022).\n- **Adjuncts:** Metformin, SGLT-2 inhibitors, and GLP-1 RAs are not standard for T1D in youth due to limited evidence and safety concerns.\n- **Technology:** Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and insulin pumps are strongly recommended for both T1D and T2D (when on insulin), improving glycemic control and reducing hypoglycemia risk.\n\n### 4. Glycemic Targets\n\n- **Type 1 and 2 Diabetes in Youth:** HbA1c target <6.5% is optimal if achievable without significant hypoglycemia; <7% may be acceptable in certain cases. Individualization is key (ISPAD 2024; ADA 2023).\n- **Adults:** ADA recommends <7% for most, with tighter or looser targets based on comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk, and life expectancy.\n\n### 5. Management of Comorbidities and Complications\n\n- **Hypertension:** Early and aggressive management with lifestyle and ACE inhibitors/ARBs if needed.\n- **Dyslipidemia:** Statin therapy is recommended for persistent LDL elevation after lifestyle intervention.\n- **Nephropathy:** Annual screening; ACE inhibitors/ARBs for albuminuria; SGLT-2 inhibitors considered in adults (emerging pediatric data).\n- **Retinopathy and Neuropathy:** Annual screening from diagnosis.\n- **Mental Health:** Regular screening for depression and distress.\n\n### 6. Social Determinants and Health Equity\n\n- Both guidelines emphasize addressing social determinants of health, food insecurity, and health inequities in care delivery.\n\n---\n\n## Critical Analysis of Evidence Quality\n\n- **ISPAD 2024 and ADA 2023** are consensus guidelines based on systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and high-quality RCTs, representing the highest level of clinical evidence.\n- **Efficacy Rates:** For youth-onset T2D, metformin and insulin have established efficacy (HbA1c reduction ~0.8–1.5%). Newer agents (GLP-1 RAs, SGLT-2 inhibitors) provide additional HbA1c lowering (up to ~1.5%) with favorable safety, based on recent RCTs.\n- **T1D:** Insulin remains the only evidence-based pharmacologic therapy; technology (CGM, pumps) improves outcomes.\n- **Limitations:** Pediatric data for many newer agents remain limited; long-term safety and comparative efficacy are still under investigation.\n\n---\n\n## Synthesis of Key Insights and Patterns\n\n- **Personalized, Stepwise Approach:** Both guidelines support individualized, stepwise intensification of therapy, prioritizing safety, efficacy, and patient/family preference.\n- **Rapid Progression in Youth-onset T2D:** Youth with T2D experience faster β-cell decline, earlier complications, and poorer response to therapy than adults, justifying aggressive management.\n- **Technology Integration:** CGM and insulin pumps are now standard elements of optimal diabetes care, especially in T1D.\n- **Comorbidity Management:** Early, routine screening and management of hypertension, dyslipidemia, nephropathy, and mental health are integral to care.\n\n---\n\n## Limitations and Gaps\n\n- **Type 1 Diabetes Treatments:** The tool output did not provide detailed, efficacy-focused summaries for T1D beyond insulin therapy.\n- **Long-term Data:** Evidence for long-term safety and efficacy of newer agents (GLP-1 RAs, SGLT-2 inhibitors) in youth is still emerging.\n- **Equity and Access:** While guidelines emphasize health equity, real-world implementation and access to advanced therapies and technology remain variable.\n\n---\n\n## Evidence-based Conclusions\n\n- **Type 1 Diabetes:** Intensive insulin therapy, with adjunct use of CGM and insulin pumps, is the standard of care and achieves the best glycemic outcomes.\n- **Type 2 Diabetes in Youth:** Metformin is first-line; insulin is required for severe cases; GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors are now evidence-based and guideline-recommended for inadequate control, with demonstrated efficacy in lowering HbA1c.\n- **Lifestyle and Comorbidity Management:** Remain foundational across all diabetes types and ages.\n- **Personalized Care:** Individualization, technology adoption, and addressing social determinants are critical for optimal outcomes.\n\n---\n\n## Future Research Directions\n\n- **Long-term Comparative Efficacy and Safety:** Head-to-head trials of newer agents in youth, especially for GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors.\n- **T1D Adjunct Therapies:** More research on safe, effective adjuncts beyond insulin.\n- **Implementation Science:** Strategies to improve access, adherence, and equity in diabetes care globally.\n\n---\n\n## Errors or Issues\n\n- **Coverage Gap:** The tool output provides comprehensive, up-to-date guidance for youth-onset T2D but lacks detailed coverage of standard-of-care treatments and efficacy rates for T1D and adult T2D as originally requested.\n- **No Major Technical Errors:** The tool executed correctly and sourced authoritative, recent guidelines.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n- ISPAD Clinical Practice Consensus Guidelines 2024: Type 2 Diabetes in Children and Adolescents (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11854986/)\n- American Diabetes Association.

It is sometimes also used to treat severe hair loss and even COVID-19. Baricitinib works by blocking the action of Janus kinase enzymes, which are involved in the inflammation process. Baricitinib helps the immune system work better.\\n\\nThe [Baricitinib in New-onset Type 1 Diabetes (BANDIT) study](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04774224) showed that people with type 1 diabetes who took baricitinib showed improved glucose levels and decreased insulin requirements, as well as preservation of beta cell function. Most participants still needed to take at least some insulin and needed to continue to monitor their glucose levels. But, after one year of treatment, it seems that the (off-label) use of baricitinib for type 1 diabetes may benefit some people if certain criteria are met.\\n\\nThe Australasian Type 1 Diabetes Immunotherapy Collaborative (ATIC) made several recommendations to healthcare professionals to guide the use of Baricitinib. These include pre-treatment tests to confirm the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and the presence of residual beta cell function, and follow up tests to check the response after six months by measuring beta cell function, insulin use, CGM metrics and HbA1c. The ATIC statement also mentioned that baricitinib treatment would need to be ongoing. It is particularly important not to miss any doses, to sustain any of the benefits of the medication. However, there is currently no data on the treatment’s effect beyond a year.\\n\\nBaricitinib is not recommended during pregnancy, for women planning to become pregnant, or while breastfeeding. Also, the use of Baricitinib would be off-label, which means that it is not covered by any PBS subsidy. A private prescription for 28 tablets is listed as costing $1046.\\n\\n#### Januse kinase (JAK) inhibitors\\n\\nThere are two different treatments, also Januse kinase (JAK) inhibitors like Baricitinib, which are currently being trialled, in what is known as the JAK POT T1D study.\\n\\n**Abrocitinib** and **Ritlecitinib** are being tested to see if they can preserve insulin production in younger people (aged 12-35) newly diagnosed with (stage 3) type 1 diabetes. Continuing to make even a small amount of insulin can help keep blood glucose levels in the target range, lowering the risk of long-term complications.\\n\\nIf either or both these treatments are successful, these JAK inhibitors may be studied in earlier stages of type 1 diabetes, to see if they can prevent or delay clinical diagnosis. For more information see: [https://www.trialnet.org/our-research/newly-diagnosed-t1d/jakpot-t1d](https://www.trialnet.org/our-research/newly-diagnosed-t1d/jakpot-t1d).\\n\\n#### Lantidra\\n\\nThe Food & Drug Administration of America (FDA), has approved [Lantidra](https://www.lantidra.com) (Donislecel), a new treatment for people with type 1 diabetes who experience frequent, severe hypoglycaemia.\\n\\nThis first-ever cell therapy works by infusing beta cells (the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin) from donors, into the hepatic portal vein. Once the newly infused beta cells start making insulin, the need for insulin injections, or insulin via pumps, may be eliminated. This transplanting of islet cells means that immune-suppressive medications are needed to avoid rejection.\\n\\nEarly data from the Lantidra trial showed that most participants gained some level of insulin independence. However, it is still uncertain if the benefits of Donislecel are greater than the safety risks. About 87% of study participants experienced infections, and there were complications after surgery, such as cuts on the liver, bruising of the liver, and anaemia.\\n\\n#### Stem cell treatments\\n\\nThere are two main methods for generating new and functional beta cells: transplanting beta cells from human donors (for example Lantidra, as in the example above) and generating beta cells from stem cells.\\n\\nAlthough both methods could be considered functional cures for type 1 diabetes, both methods require the person to take immune-suppressant medications (also known as anti-rejection medications) for the rest of their lives. This is to avoid these new beta cells from being attacked by the person’s own immune system, similar to how their original beta cells got destroyed.\\n\\nHowever, researchers think that they may be able to alter the genetic code of implanted cells, so that they can avoid recognition by the immune system. This would mean that they may evade an immune system attack. Pre-clinical trials (done in test-tubes and on animals) had minimal side effects and seemed to be well-tolerated. Clinical trials are being conducted in this area, so watch this space for future updates.

This new technology encapsulates the insulin in nano-carriers, particles 1/10,000th the width of a human hair. Scientists have created a special coating that protects the insulin from being broken down until it reaches the liver. Once the coating is broken down by liver enzymes (that are only active when the blood glucose levels are high), the insulin will either store glucose in the liver, as it would in people who do not have diabetes, or the insulin will enter the bloodstream to rapidly move to areas of the body that need it most.\\n\\nIt is said that this nanotechnology can lower blood glucose levels without causing a low blood glucose level. Interestingly, the new insulin can be eaten by taking a capsule or within a piece chocolate as they did in the trials on baboons.\\n\\n[Animal studies are completed and scientists are ready to trial this new insulin on humans in 2025](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/01/240119122649.htm#:~:text=Researchers%20have%20found%20a%20new,tested%20on%20humans%20in%202025.). It will be at least a few years before needle-free insulin will be available commercially.\\n\\n#### Microbiome\\n\\nIn the past 10 years or so lots of research has highlighted the important role microbes (micro-organisms) play. The human microbiome (communities of micro-organisms such as fungi, bacteria, and viruses), especially the gut microbiome, has been linked to multiple chronic conditions, including diabetes.\\n\\nIt may be a strange story, but Dutch researchers proved that [transferring microbiome from a healthy person to the gut of a person with diabetes](https://gut.bmj.com/content/70/1/92), through what is called a faecal transplant, can result in short-term improvement of insulin resistance. This has led to some companies trying to develop diabetes treatments that target the microbiome.\\n\\n[Microbiome research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38078135/) is still in its infancy and appears to be a difficult area of research; it is expected to take perhaps another decade for major developments in this space to result in readily available options.\\n\\n## New developments for people with (or at risk of) **type 2 diabetes**\\n\\n#### Mounjaro\\n\\nMounjaro was approved by the TGA for the management in type 2 diabetes in 2023.  It is now also approved for use in chronic weight management.\\n\\nAdditionally, Mounjaro is now available in a [multi-dose, pre-filled pen device](https://www.tga.gov.au/safety/shortages/medicine-shortage-alerts/update-supply-mounjaro-tirzepatide-injections). It is important to note, that your pharmacist cannot dispense the Mounjaro KwikPen using a prescription for the vial, so if you are switching to the KwikPen you will need a new prescription.\\n\\nUnfortunately, all strengths of Mounjaro vials will continue to be limited into 2025, “due to an unexpected increase in demand”. The TGA also reports that it is not known what impact the introduction of the Mounjaro KwikPen, and the new indication for chronic weight management, will have on the overall availability of Mounjaro products. The [Medicine Shortage Reports Database](https://apps.tga.gov.au/Prod/msi/Search/Details/tirzepatide) lists the latest supply status of the different strengths available.\\n\\nTo help during the shortage of Mounjaro vials, the TGA has approved the temporary supply of an overseas-registered tirzepatide product, Mounjaro KwikPen (UK) and they recommend that, if patients are unable to fill their script for the correct strength or presentation of Mounjaro in time for their next dose, they should contact their doctor immediately to have their treatment plan reassessed.\\n\\n#### PATAS\\n\\nA French biotech company, is developing a medication called PATAS in conjunction with a team of international researchers, including some from Monash University in Melbourne. PATAS targets insulin resistance by rebooting how fat cells use insulin.\\n\\nPATAS may have the potential to prevent the development of type 2 diabetes. It could also have other health benefits in chronic medical disorders caused by insulin resistance, including cardiac diseases, fatty liver, and the metabolic syndrome.\\n\\nPATAS works by correcting an abnormality in fat cells by separating two proteins, which are associated with insulin resistance by blocking insulin from initiating glucose uptake. Early studies have shown PATAS to help these cells absorb glucose without needing insulin. Human clinical trials are likely to start in 2025. It could be delivered via a simple injection and possibly via a patch.\\n\\n#### Rybelsus\\n\\nOnce-daily [Rybelsus](https://www.rybelsus.com) tablets are a prescription medication used to treat type 2 diabetes. The active ingredient in Rybelsus is Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist. This means that it is the same active ingredient as the once weekly injectable GLP-1 medications Ozempic and Wegovy, but in a pill.\\n\\nRybelsus stimulates the pancreas to release more insulin when blood glucose levels are high and prevents the liver from making and releasing too much sugar. It also slows gastric emptying, which means food is slower to leave the stomach after eating. As such, Rybelsus is not suitable for people with type 1 diabetes due to the increased risk of hypoglycaemia associated with this delayed gastric emptying.\\n\\nRybelsus has the same potential side-effects as injectable Semaglutide: nausea, stomach pain, diarrhoea, decreased appetite, constipation, and weight reduction. This medication was approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in February 2022, it is not known if or when it will be available in Australia, on the PBS.\\n\\n#### Sidapvia\\n\\nAustralians with type 2 diabetes are able to access [Sidapvia](https://www.pbs.gov.au/medicine/item/14638K-14645T) through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) as of November 2024. This new listing gives people with type 2 diabetes an additional treatment option.\\n\\nSidapvia is a combination medication that has both dapagliflozin (know as Forxiga) and sitagliptin (known as Januvia) in the one tablet. It should be used in combination with Metformin, and alongside a healthy diet and regular physical activity.\\n\\nIt does not normally cause hypoglycaemia, although users may experience a low blood glucose level if taking  this medication in combination with certain other medicines, such as insulin or a sulfonylurea (for example gliclazide, glibenclamide or glimepiride).\\n\\nSidapvia is not recommended for use during pregnancy or when breastfeeding. It is also not recommended for use in children or in people with type 1 diabetes.\\n\\n#### Interested in learning more about medications?\\n\\n![](https://www.diabetesqualified.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DQ-DiP-Nurses_Main-image_with_Banner_Text_1.png)\\n\\nOur **Managing diabetes course bite** provides practical guidance on managing diabetes, helping you support your patients with confidence.

Clinical Trials Identifier: NCT06334133 Trial status: Recruiting Trial Name:  Cadisegliatin as Adjunctive Therapy to Insulin in Participants With Type 1 Diabetes (CATT1) Diabetes Type: Type 1 diabetes Trial Sponsor:  vTv Therapeutics What is the aim of the study?  This study is testing whether the oral medication cadisegliatin can help reduce hypoglycemia in people with  type 1 diabetes.  Cadisegliatin is a medication categorized as a liver-selective glucokinase activator. It is intended to help improve liver function when glucose levels are high. Specifically, cadisegliatin is thought to trap glucose inside liver cells and promote glucose uptake and storage.  Because cadisegliatin works differently than other diabetes medications, it may be useful as a non-insulin medication that can be used alongside insulin to help manage blood sugar. There is currently only one such therapy approved for type 1 diabetes:  Symlin (pramlintide), an injectable medication that must be taken before each meal. How does the trial work?  Participants will be randomly assigned to the treatment group or the placebo group. Those assigned to a treatment group will receive 800 mg of cadisegliatin, either once per day or twice per day, for 26 weeks. Both the treatment and placebo groups will continue using insulin during this time. They must have used a  CGM device for at least the prior three months.  Before the treatment period, participants will complete a 14-day screening period, followed by a 28-day training with an insulin pump or multiple daily insulin injections (but not an  automated insulin delivery system) and an insulin adjustment period, and then a 28-day baseline period. To determine the safety and effectiveness of cadisegliatin, researchers will measure the number of level 2 or level 3 hypoglycemic events, along with changes in A1C,  time in range, DKA events, average total daily insulin, and body weight. Why is the cadisegliatin trial important?  Many people with type 1 diabetes experience hypoglycemia, which can disrupt everyday life and be dangerous if left untreated. Frequent low blood sugar episodes can lead to complications like  hypoglycemia unawareness, cognitive dysfunction, and heart problems.  Previous research has shown promising results for cadisegliatin in type 1 diabetes. In an earlier trial, cadisegliatin led to a 40% reduction in the frequency of severe hypoglycemic events.  Based on these findings, cadisegliatin received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA. This means the FDA designated cadisegliatin as a drug that has an advantage over existing options for people with type 1 diabetes.  According to vTv Therapeutics, cadisegliatin has been studied in nearly 600 participants to date, including those with type 2 diabetes. Are you interested in participating?  You may be eligible if you:  Are 18 years or older and have been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes for at least five years Have an A1C under 9.5% Have experienced at least one hypoglycemic event with glucose below 54 mg/dL or a severe hypoglycemic event in the past two months Are currently using an insulin pump or multiple daily injections Have used a CGM for at least three months People who use automated insulin delivery (AID) systems or take non-insulin diabetes medications (such as SGLT2s, DPP-4s, GLP-1s, or metformin) are not eligible for this study.  This study is recruiting in California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, North Carolina, Oregon, and Texas.

Key developments involve innovative drug classes (such as JAK inhibitors and liver-selective glucokinase activators), new delivery methods (needle-free insulin), and cell-based therapies, with several promising candidates in late-stage clinical trials or recently approved. While some therapies show substantial potential, issues such as safety, long-term efficacy, cost, and accessibility remain.\n\n---\n\n**Introduction: Context and Scope**  \nThis synthesis analyzes the latest innovations in diabetes treatments and technologies from 2022 to 2024, focusing on new medications, delivery methods, and clinical trial results for type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The review draws from two recent, credible web sources: Diabetes Qualified (2024) and diaTribe (2024), both recognized for reliable, up-to-date diabetes information.\n\n---\n\n**Main Findings Organized by Themes**\n\n**1. Type 1 Diabetes: Emerging Medications and Therapies**  \n- **Baricitinib (Olumiant):** Originally for rheumatoid arthritis, this JAK inhibitor showed in the BANDIT study that it can improve glucose levels, decrease insulin requirements, and preserve beta cell function in new-onset type 1 diabetes. However, it remains off-label, expensive, and requires ongoing use; long-term safety is unknown. (Diabetes Qualified, 2024)\n- **Other JAK Inhibitors (Abrocitinib, Ritlecitinib):** Currently in the JAK POT T1D trial for newly diagnosed (stage 3) type 1 diabetes, aiming to preserve endogenous insulin production in younger individuals. If successful, these drugs may be tested for diabetes prevention. (Diabetes Qualified, 2024)\n- **Cadisegliatin:** A liver-selective glucokinase activator, now in a phase III clinical trial (CATT1), aims to reduce hypoglycemia when used alongside insulin. Previous studies showed a 40% reduction in severe hypoglycemic events, earning FDA breakthrough therapy designation. (diaTribe, 2024)\n- **Lantidra (Donislecel):** Recently FDA-approved cell therapy for people with type 1 diabetes and frequent severe hypoglycemia. It involves islet cell transplantation, offering some insulin independence but with high rates of infection and surgical complications; requires lifelong immunosuppression. (Diabetes Qualified, 2024)\n- **Stem Cell Therapies:** Early-stage clinical trials are exploring stem cell-derived beta cell implants. While potentially curative, these also necessitate immunosuppression, though gene-editing approaches may eventually obviate this need. (Diabetes Qualified, 2024)\n\n**2. Cross-Type Innovations (Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes)**\n- **Needle-Free/Oral Insulin:** Nanotechnology-based oral insulin encapsulation has succeeded in animal studies, protecting insulin until liver delivery and activating only when blood glucose is high. Human trials are expected to begin in 2025. (Diabetes Qualified, 2024)\n- **Microbiome-Based Therapies:** Fecal microbiota transplantation has shown short-term improvements in insulin resistance. However, the field is nascent, and clinically available options are at least a decade away. (Diabetes Qualified, 2024)\n\n**3. Type 2 Diabetes: New Medications and Combinations**\n- **Mounjaro (Tirzepatide):** Approved for both type 2 diabetes and chronic weight management, now available in a multi-dose pen. Ongoing supply shortages may affect access. (Diabetes Qualified, 2024)\n- **PATAS:** A novel agent targeting insulin resistance at the fat cell level, potentially preventing type 2 diabetes and treating related metabolic disorders. Human trials are anticipated in 2025. (Diabetes Qualified, 2024)\n- **Rybelsus (Oral Semaglutide):** Once-daily oral GLP-1 agonist for type 2 diabetes, offering an alternative to injectable semaglutide. Not yet widely available in Australia. (Diabetes Qualified, 2024)\n- **Sidapvia:** A new fixed-dose combination of dapagliflozin (SGLT2 inhibitor) and sitagliptin (DPP-4 inhibitor), PBS-listed in Australia as of November 2024. Must be used with metformin. (Diabetes Qualified, 2024)\n\n---\n\n**Critical Analysis of Evidence Quality**  \n- **Clinical Evidence:** Most innovations are supported by early-phase or mid-phase clinical trials, with some (e.g., Lantidra, Mounjaro) having regulatory approvals based on robust data. However, for several therapies (e.g., JAK inhibitors, PATAS, oral insulin, stem cell therapies), long-term efficacy and safety remain to be established.\n- **Source Reliability:** Both Diabetes Qualified and diaTribe are reputable, with clear referencing of clinical trials and regulatory updates. However, the Diabetes Qualified article is a secondary source summarizing recent research, not presenting original data.\n- **Limitations:** Many treatments are either off-label, in clinical trials, or have restricted access due to cost, regulatory status, or supply shortages. Side effects (e.g., immunosuppression risks with cell therapies, GI side effects with GLP-1 agonists) and safety concerns (e.g., high infection rates with Lantidra) are significant.\n\n---\n\n**Synthesis of Key Insights and Patterns**  \n- The diabetes treatment landscape is rapidly diversifying, with a shift toward disease-modifying and adjunctive therapies, not just glucose-lowering drugs.\n- There is convergence on immune-modulating approaches (JAK inhibitors, stem cell/gene-editing therapies) for type 1 diabetes, and on combination and oral therapies for type 2 diabetes.\n- Non-invasive delivery methods (oral insulin) and microbiome interventions represent promising but still experimental frontiers.\n- Accessibility and cost remain major barriers, even as regulatory approvals accelerate.\n\n---\n\n**Limitations and Gaps Identified**  \n- Most new therapies, especially for type 1 diabetes, are in early or mid-stage trials with limited long-term data.\n- Safety profiles, especially for immune-modulating and cell-based therapies, are not fully established.\n- Many therapies are not yet widely available due to regulatory, cost, or supply chain issues.\n- Microbiome-based and genetic therapies are not expected to reach clinical practice for years.\n\n---\n\n**Evidence-Based Conclusions**  \n- Several promising new medications and technologies for diabetes have emerged since 2022, including JAK inhibitors, liver-selective glucokinase activators, and cell-based therapies for type 1 diabetes, as well as novel oral and combination therapies for type 2 diabetes.\n- While some, like Mounjaro and Lantidra, have received regulatory approval, most new agents are still in clinical trials, and their ultimate impact will depend on long-term efficacy, safety, cost, and accessibility.\n- The trend is toward more personalized, less invasive, and potentially disease-modifying treatments, but significant barriers remain before these innovations become standard of care.\n\n---\n\n**Future Research Directions**  \n- Large-scale, long-term trials are needed to establish the safety and durability of JAK inhibitors, stem cell therapies, and oral insulin.\n- Research into immunosuppression-free cell therapies and gene-editing approaches is a priority.\n- Further investigation into microbiome-targeted therapies and their mechanisms is warranted.\n- Health systems research should address cost, access, and implementation challenges for new diabetes treatments.\n\n---\n\n**Errors or Issues in Tool Output**  \n- No technical errors were detected in the tool output. However, some summaries were overly brief and omitted important details (e.g., safety concerns, regulatory status, and trial phases).\n- The output did not explicitly distinguish between therapies available now and those still under investigation; this distinction is critical for clinical and policy decision-making.\n\n---\n\n**References**  \n- Diabetes Qualified.

Query Analysis: The user is looking for evidence-based standard of care treatments for both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, with a focus on treatments that have the highest efficacy rates according to recent (2023-2024) clinical guidelines and meta-analyses.\n\n2. Complexity Assessment: This rates as 8/10 because it requires synthesizing information from multiple authoritative sources, understanding clinical guidelines, comparing efficacy rates, and distinguishing between different diabetes types and patient populations.\n\n3. Strategy Selection: I'll use a comprehensive synthesis approach because the tool output contains extensive information from clinical practice guidelines (ISPAD 2024, ADA 2023) and information about innovative treatments.\n\n4. Content Analysis:\n   - The first search result provides the ISPAD Clinical Practice Consensus Guidelines 2024 for Type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents, with detailed information on diagnosis, management approaches, pharmacological treatments, and complication management.\n   - The second search result covers the American Diabetes Association's 2023 Standards of Care, highlighting key updates to diabetes management guidelines.\n   - The third search result (from a second search) provides information on innovative and emerging diabetes treatments from 2022-2024.\n\n5. Key Information Extraction:\n   - For Type 2 Diabetes in youth: Metformin is first-line therapy for HbA1c <8.5%; insulin is needed for higher HbA1c or metabolic decompensation; newer agents like GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors are now approved for youth.\n   - For Type 1 Diabetes: Insulin remains the cornerstone of therapy; technology like CGM and insulin pumps improve outcomes.\n   - For adults: Guidelines emphasize personalized approaches with multiple medication options and strong evidence for cardio-renal protection with newer agents.\n   - Emerging treatments include JAK inhibitors, oral insulin, cell therapies, and microbiome-based approaches.\n\n6. Synthesis Plan: I'll organize the summary by diabetes type, highlighting standard treatments with highest efficacy according to guidelines, then briefly mention emerging treatments.\n</thinking>\n\n# Evidence-Based Standard of Care Treatments for Diabetes: 2023-2024 Guidelines\n\nBased on the search results, here's a summary of current evidence-based standard of care treatments for diabetes with the highest efficacy rates according to recent clinical guidelines and meta-analyses:\n\n## Type 1 Diabetes\n\n**Core Treatment:**\n- **Insulin therapy** remains the cornerstone treatment, with no viable pharmacological alternatives\n- **Intensive insulin regimens** (multiple daily injections or insulin pump therapy) show highest efficacy for glycemic control\n- **Technology integration** with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and automated insulin delivery systems significantly improves outcomes\n\n**Emerging Adjunctive Therapies:**\n- **Baricitinib (Olumiant)** - JAK inhibitor showing promise in preserving beta cell function in new-onset T1D\n- **Cadisegliatin** - Liver-selective glucokinase activator in clinical trials, showing 40% reduction in severe hypoglycemic events\n- **Lantidra (Donislecel)** - FDA-approved cell therapy for severe hypoglycemia, though requiring immunosuppression\n\n## Type 2 Diabetes in Youth\n\n**First-line Treatment:**\n- **Metformin** for HbA1c <8.5% (moderate hyperglycemia) with lifestyle modifications\n- **Insulin** required initially for HbA1c ≥8.5%, ketosis, or acidosis\n\n**Second-line/Add-on Therapies (FDA/EMA approved for youth):**\n- **GLP-1 receptor agonists:**\n  - **Liraglutide** - HbA1c reduction of 0.64% at 26 weeks (ETD: 1.06%)\n  - **Exenatide** - HbA1c reduction of 0.36% at 24 weeks (ETD: 0.85%)\n  - **Dulaglutide** - HbA1c reduction of 0.9% at 26 weeks (ETD: 1.5%)\n\n- **SGLT-2 inhibitors:**\n  - **Empagliflozin** - HbA1c reduction of 0.17% at 26 weeks (ETD: 0.84%)\n  - **Dapagliflozin** - HbA1c reduction of 0.25-0.62% (ETD: 0.75-1.03%)\n\n**Surgical Option:**\n- **Bariatric surgery** for youth ≥12 years with BMI ≥35 kg/m² and inadequate glycemic control with medications\n\n## Type 2 Diabetes in Adults\n\n**Stepwise Approach Based on ADA 2023 Standards:**\n1. **Metformin** remains first-line pharmacotherapy with lifestyle modifications\n2. **Cardio-renal protective agents** recommended early, especially for high-risk patients:\n   - **GLP-1 receptor agonists** (semaglutide, dulaglutide, tirzepatide)\n   - **SGLT-2 inhibitors** (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin)\n\n**Key Updates in 2023-2024 Guidelines:**\n- Emphasis on **higher weight loss goals** (up to 15%) with newer medications\n- Expanded role of **SGLT-2 inhibitors** in heart failure management\n- Role of **finerenone** for diabetic kidney disease with albuminuria\n- Lower **LDL goals** for high-risk individuals\n- Consideration of **social determinants of health** in treatment planning\n\n**Innovative Treatments:**\n- **Tirzepatide (Mounjaro)** - Dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist with superior efficacy for glycemic control and weight loss\n- **Oral semaglutide (Rybelsus)** - First oral GLP-1 RA\n- **Fixed-dose combinations** like Sidapvia (dapagliflozin + sitagliptin)\n\n## Glycemic Targets\n\n- **Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes in Youth:** HbA1c target <6.5% optimal if achievable without significant hypoglycemia\n- **Adults:** HbA1c <7% for most, with individualization based on comorbidities and hypoglycemia risk\n\n## Comprehensive Care Approach\n\nBoth ISPAD and ADA guidelines emphasize:\n- Regular screening for complications (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy)\n- Aggressive management of cardiovascular risk factors\n- Mental health support and addressing social determinants of health\n- Technology integration when appropriate and accessible\n\nThe guidelines highlight the importance of individualized, patient-centered approaches to diabetes management, with treatment decisions based on efficacy, safety, cost, patient preferences, and comorbidities."
