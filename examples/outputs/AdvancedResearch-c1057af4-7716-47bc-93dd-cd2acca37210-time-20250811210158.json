This is because an unacceptable level of a probable carcinogen (cancer-causing agent) was found in some extended-release metformin tablets. If you currently take this drug, call your healthcare professional. They will advise whether you should continue to take your medication or if you need a new prescription.\\n\\nWhen you have diabetes, your body has difficulty managing insulin. [Insulin](https://www.healthline.com/health/type-2-diabetes/insulin) is a hormone your [pancreas](https://www.healthline.com/health/diabetes-and-pancreas) produces that helps your body use [glucose](https://www.healthline.com/health/glucose) (sugar) from the food you eat.\\n\\nInsulin moves glucose from your bloodstream into your cells, which use it for energy. But if your body doesn’t make enough insulin or doesn’t use it properly, the glucose stays in your blood.\\n\\nHaving [high blood glucose](https://www.healthline.com/health/blood-sugar-spike) levels for too long can damage parts of your body.\\n\\nThere are two types of diabetes: [type 1 and type 2](https://www.healthline.com/health/difference-between-type-1-and-type-2-diabetes). People with [type 1 diabetes](https://www.healthline.com/health/type-1-diabetes-causes-symtoms-treatments) cannot make their own insulin. People with [type 2 diabetes](https://www.healthline.com/health/type-2-diabetes) can make insulin, but their bodies are not able to use it properly.\\n\\nThe only medication used to treat type 1 diabetes is insulin, and it comes in different types.\\n\\nType 2 diabetes can be treated with a broader range of medications. Some people with type 2 diabetes may need to take more than one type of medication to treat their condition.\\n\\nRead on to learn about new diabetes drug options and drugs that are currently being developed, as well as medications commonly used for both types of diabetes.\\n\\n## New medications for diabetes\\n\\nIn recent years, several new diabetes drugs have been developed. These include oral and injectable drugs.\\n\\n### New oral drugs\\n\\nExcept for [Steglatro](https://www.healthline.com/health/drugs/steglatro-dosage), which contains only one drug, the new oral drugs used to treat type 2 diabetes are all combination drugs. They each combine two drugs used on their own to treat type 2 diabetes.\\n\\nThese medications are all brand-name drugs that don’t have generic forms.\\n\\n#### Xigduo XR\\n\\nXigduo XR, which comes as a 24-hour extended-release oral tablet, was approved for use in [2014](https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=ac8a0f7b-9f69-4495-abbc-3a47cd75a859). Xigduo XR combines [metformin](https://healthline.com/health/metformin-oral-tablet) with [dapagliflozin](https://healthline.com/health/dapagliflozin-oral-tablet).\\n\\nMetformin helps make body tissues more sensitive to insulin.\\n\\nDapagliflozin blocks some of the glucose in your body from reentering your blood through your [kidneys](https://www.healthline.com/human-body-maps/kidney). This causes your body to get rid of more glucose through your urine.\\n\\n#### Synjardy\\n\\n[Synjardy](https://www.healthline.com/health/drugs/synjardy-dosage), which is also available as Synjardy XR and comes as an oral tablet, was approved for use in [2015](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2017/206111s015lbl.pdf). It combines the drugs metformin and [empagliflozin](https://healthline.com/health/empagliflozin-oral-tablet). Empagliflozin works in a similar way to dapagliflozin.\\n\\n#### Glyxambi\\n\\n[Glyxambi](https://www.healthline.com/health/drugs/glyxambi-dosage), which comes as an oral tablet, was approved for use in [2015](https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=ddbab689-f76c-488c-9613-4168d41dd730). It combines the drugs linagliptin and empagliflozin.\\n\\nLinagliptin blocks the breakdown of certain hormones in your body that tell your pancreas to make and release insulin. It also slows your digestion, which slows the release of glucose into your blood.\\n\\n#### Steglujan\\n\\nSteglujan, which comes as an oral tablet, was approved in late [2017](https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=c2c553d8-5a9d-4366-bf53-8bdb5a876d19). It combines ertugliflozin and [sitagliptin](https://www.healthline.com/health/drugs/sitagliptin-oral-tablet).\\n\\nErtugliflozin works through the same mechanism as empagliflozin.\\n\\nSitagliptin blocks the breakdown of certain hormones in your body that tell your pancreas to make and release insulin. It also slows your [digestion](https://www.healthline.com/health/digestive-health), which slows the absorption of glucose into your blood.\\n\\n#### Segluromet\\n\\nSegluromet, which comes as an oral tablet, was approved in late [2017](https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=a6aeb99a-ce49-4125-90ce-642df3f1ebad). It combines ertugliflozin and metformin.\\n\\n#### Steglatro\\n\\n[Steglatro](https://www.healthline.com/health/drugs/steglatro-dosage), which comes as an oral tablet, was approved in late [2017](https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=e6f3e718-bb99-48f1-ab94-b9f0af05fed6). It’s a brand-name form of the drug ertugliflozin. It works through the same mechanism as empagliflozin.\\n\\nLike the combination drugs in this list, Steglatro is used to treat type 2 diabetes.\\n\\n### New injectables\\n\\nThese new brand-name injectables are not available as generic drugs. They’re used to treat either type 2 diabetes, or both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\\n\\nThese drugs contain a type of insulin, a [GLP-1 agonist](https://www.healthline.com/health/type-2-diabetes/glp-1-receptor-agonists-treatment), or both. The different types of injected insulin act as a replacement for the insulin your body doesn’t make or can’t use properly.\\n\\nGlucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists help your pancreas release more insulin when your glucose level is high. They also slow down glucose absorption during digestion.\\n\\n#### Tresiba\\n\\n[Tresiba](https://www.healthline.com/health/drugs/tresiba-dosage), which was approved in [2015](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2016/203314s003lbl.pdf), is a brand-name version of the drug insulin degludec. It’s used to treat both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\\n\\nTresiba is a long-acting insulin that lasts up to [42 hours](https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=456c5e87-3dfd-46fa-8ac0-c6128d4c97c6#:~:text=TRESIBA%20is%20a%20long%2Dacting,Limitations%20of%20Use%3A&text=Not%20recommended%20for%20the%20treatment%20of%20diabetic%20ketoacidosis.). This is longer than commonly used insulin. It’s injected once daily.\\n\\n#### Basaglar and Toujeo\\n\\n[Basaglar](https://www.healthline.com/health/cdi/basaglar) and [Toujeo](https://www.healthline.com/health/cdi/toujeo) are two new forms of insulin glargine. They’re used to treat both type 1 and type 2 diabetes and are both injected once daily.\\n\\nBasaglar is a long-acting insulin drug that was approved in [2015](https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=0ad21db3-2b1c-4ed9-a687-bdd6a74d0aae). It’s similar to another [insulin glargine](https://www.healthline.com/health/drugs/insulin-glargine-injectable-solution) drug called [Lantus](https://www.healthline.com/health/cdi/lantus). It lasts for 24 hours.\\n\\nToujeo is a more concentrated form of insulin glargine. It was approved for use in [2015](https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=257ca17b-6ff7-4f2e-9037-4c185bac5768) and lasts for 36 hours.\\n\\n#### Xultophy\\n\\n[Xultophy](https://www.healthline.com/health/cdi/xultophy) was approved in [2016](http://www.novo-pi.com/xultophy10036.pdf). It’s only used to treat type 2 diabetes. Xultophy is injected once per day.\\n\\nXultophy combines insulin degludec, a long-acting insulin, and liraglutide, a GLP-1 agonist.\\n\\n#### Soliqua\\n\\n[Soliqua](https://www.healthline.com/health/drugs/soliqua) was approved in [2016](https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=4bba538b-cf7c-4310-ae8f-cb711ed21bcc). It’s only used to treat type 2 diabetes. It’s injected once per day.\\n\\nSoliqua combines the drug insulin glargine with lixisenatide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist.\\n\\n#### Ozempic and Rybelsus\\n\\n[Ozempic](https://www.healthline.com/health/cdi/ozempic) was approved in late [2017](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2017/209637lbl.pdf). It’s only used to treat type 2 diabetes.\\n\\nOzempic and Rybelsus are a brand-name version of the GLP-1 agonist called semaglutide. It’s injected once per week.\\n\\n#### Adlyxin\\n\\nAdlyxin was approved in [2016](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2016/208471Orig1s000lbl.pdf). It’s only used to treat type 2 diabetes.\\n\\nAdlyxin is a brand-name version of the GLP-1 agonist called lixisenatide. It’s injected once daily.\\n\\n## Diabetes medications in development\\n\\nIn addition to these new medications, several diabetes drugs are currently in development. These drugs include:\\n\\n- **Oral-Lyn:** This brand-name drug comes as a fast-acting oral insulin spray. It’s designed to treat both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\\n- **Dance 501:** This aerosol device contains a liquid insulin that is intended to be inhaled at mealtime. It’s designed to treat both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\\n\\n## Commonly used diabetes drugs\\n\\nNow that you know about new and upcoming diabetes drugs, here’s a list of some of the diabetes drugs that are currently used most often. Some of these drugs are components of the new combination medications listed above, as well as the older combination medications listed below.\\n\\n### Oral medications\\n\\nThe following groups of drugs are commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes. All come as oral tablets. Metformin also comes as an oral solution.\\n\\n#### Biguanides such as metformin\\n\\n[Metformin](https://healthline.com/health/metformin-oral-tablet) is often the first drug used to treat type 2 diabetes. It works by slowing glucose production in your liver. It also makes your body tissues more sensitive to insulin, which helps the tissues absorb glucose.\\n\\nMetformin is also combined with other oral medications to reduce the number of tablets you need to take.\\n\\n#### Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors\\n\\nThese drugs slow or block the breakdown of [carbohydrates](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/carbohydrate-functions) in your body. Carbohydrates are in starchy or sugary foods. This action slows the absorption of glucose into your bloodstream.\\n\\nExamples of these drugs include:\\n\\n- [acarbose](https://healthline.com/health/acarbose-oral-tablet)\\n- miglitol\\n\\n#### Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-IV inhibitors)\\n\\nThese drugs block the breakdown of certain hormones in your body that tell your pancreas to make and release insulin. These drugs also slow your digestion, which slows the release of glucose into your blood.\\n\\nExamples of these drugs include:\\n\\n- alogliptin\\n- linagliptin\\n- saxagliptin\\n- [sitagliptin](https://healthline.com/health/sitagliptin/oral-tablet)\\n\\n#### Meglitinides\\n\\nThese drugs tell your pancreas to release insulin.\\n\\nExamples of these drugs include:\\n\\n- [nateglinide](https://www.healthline.com/health/drugs/nateglinide-cost)\\n- [repaglinide](https://www.healthline.com/health/drugs/repaglinide-cost)\\n\\n#### Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2)\\n\\nThese drugs block some of the glucose in your system from reentering your blood through your kidneys. They also cause your body to get rid of more glucose through your urine.\\n\\nExamples of these drugs include:\\n\\n- canagliflozin\\n- dapagliflozin\\n- [empagliflozin](https://healthline.com/health/empagliflozin-oral-tablet)\\n- ertugliflozin\\n\\n#### Sulfonylureas\\n\\nThese drugs cause your pancreas to release more insulin.\\n\\nExamples of these drugs include:\\n\\n- [glimepiride](https://healthline.com/health/glimepiride/oral-tablet)\\n- [glipizide](https://healthline.com/health/glipizide-oral-tablet)\\n- [glyburide](https://healthline.com/health/glyburide-oral-tablet)\\n\\n#### Thiazolidinediones\\n\\nThese drugs, such as pioglitazone, make your body tissues more sensitive to insulin. This helps your body use more of the glucose in your blood.\\n\\n#### Combination medications\\n\\nIn addition to the new ones listed above, several combination medications have been available for a while. Older combination medications include the following:\\n\\n- **Duetact** is a tablet that combines pioglitazone with glimepiride.\\n- **[Janumet](https://www.healthline.com/health/drugs/janumet-dosage)** is a tablet that combines sitagliptin with metformin.\\n- A generic drug that comes as a tablet combines **metformin** with **glipizide** (brand-name Metaglip).\\n- The drug **pioglitazone** is available in tablet form in combination with **metformin**.\\n\\n### Injectable medications\\n\\nThe following classes of drugs come in injectable forms.\\n\\n#### Insulin\\n\\nInjected insulin acts as a replacement for the insulin your body doesn’t make or can’t use properly. It can be used to treat type 1 or type 2 diabetes.\\n\\nDifferent types of insulin are available. Some types act quickly. These types help control your blood glucose level at mealtime.\\n\\nOther types act over a longer period. These types control your blood glucose level throughout the day and night.\\n\\nSome types of insulin include:\\n\\n- insulin aspart (Novolog, NovoLog FlexPen, Fiasp, ReliOn NovoLog)\\n- insulin degludec (Tresiba)\\n- insulin glargine (Semglee)\\n\\n#### Amylin analogue\\n\\nThe amylin analogue called pramlintide is taken before a meal. It helps to decrease the amount of insulin you need. It’s used to treat both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\\n\\n#### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 agonists)\\n\\nThese drugs help your pancreas release more insulin when your glucose level is high. They also slow down glucose absorption during digestion. These drugs are used to treat type 2 diabetes only.\\n\\nExamples of these drugs include:\\n\\n- dulaglutide\\n- exenatide\\n- liraglutide\\n- semaglutide\\n\\n## Things to consider when choosing a drug\\n\\nWhile many effective diabetes drugs have been on the market for years, new drugs may provide benefits that aren’t available with most commonly used drugs.\\n\\nKeep in mind that all the side effects and interactions of new drugs may not currently be known. Also, newer drugs may cost more than older drugs or may not yet be covered by most insurance plans.\\n\\nIn addition, your insurance plan may prefer certain drugs over others, or they may require you to do a trial of older, less expensive medications before they cover the newer, more expensive drugs.\\n\\nIt’s important to talk with your doctor if you’re considering new diabetes drug options. Discuss your full medical history with your doctor, as well as all medications and supplements you take.\\n\\nTogether, you and your doctor can decide which new drugs, if any, may be right for you.\\n\\nLast medically reviewed on August 11, 2022\\n\\n### How we reviewed this article:\\n\\nSources\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nHealthline has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical associations.

However, individuals with type 1 diabetes must rely on insulin for blood glucose (blood sugar) management. Many type 2 diabetes medications, including oral and injectable options, work in different ways to regulate blood glucose levels.\\n\\nManaging type 2 diabetes involves a comprehensive approach that includes meal planning, regular physical activity, and the right diabetes medications. By combining these three strategies, individuals can effectively regulate their blood glucose levels. Oral medications for type 2 diabetes are commonly prescribed as part of a treatment plan to help maintain stable blood glucose levels.\\n\\nDiabetes is a progressive disease and medications sometimes stop working as well over time. When this happens adjustments to your medication or combination therapy can help, which may include adding insulin to your treatment plan. This doesn't mean you're doing something wrong.\\n\\nEven if diabetes other medications do bring your blood glucose levels near the normal range, you may need to take insulin if you have a severe infection or need surgery. Other medications may not be able to keep your blood glucose levels in your target range during these stressful times that affect your blood glucose.\\n\\nThere are different types, or classes, of medications that work in different ways to lower blood glucose levels. Some options are taken by mouth and others are injected. Some of the commonly used classes of non-insulin medications include:\\n\\n- Metformin\\n- Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors\\n- Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 receptor agonists\\n- Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors\\n- Sulfonylureas\\n- Thiazolidinediones (TZDs)\\n\\n\\n### Metformin\\n\\nMetformin (Glucophage) is classified as a biguanide medication and is the only available medication in this class. Metformin lowers blood glucose levels primarily by decreasing the amount of glucose produced by the liver. Metformin also helps lower blood glucose levels by making muscle tissue more sensitive to insulin so blood glucose can be used for energy.\\n\\nIt is usually taken two times a day. A side effect of metformin may be diarrhea, but this is improved when the drug is taken with food.\\n\\n### DPP-4 Inhibitors\\n\\nDPP-4 inhibitors help improve [A1C](https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/a1c) (a measure of average blood glucose levels over two to three months) without causing [hypoglycemia](https://diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/treatment-care/hypoglycemia) (low blood glucose). They work by preventing the breakdown of naturally occurring hormones in the body, GLP-1 and GIP. These hormones reduce blood glucose levels in the body, but they are broken down very quickly so it does not work well when injected as a drug itself.\\n\\nBy interfering in the process that breaks down GLP-1 and GIP, DPP-4 inhibitors allow these hormones to remain active in the body longer, lowering blood glucose levels only when they are elevated. DPP-4 inhibitors do not cause weight gain and are usually very well tolerated.\\n\\nThere are four DPP-4 inhibitors currently on the market in the U.S.:\\n\\n- Alogliptin (Nesina)\\n- Linagliptin (Tradjenta)\\n- Saxagliptin (Onglyza)\\n- Sitagliptin (Januvia)\\n\\n### GLP-1 and Dual GLP-1/GIP Receptor Agonists\\n\\nAs noted in the description for DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 and GIP are natural hormones in the body that help maintain glucose levels. Use of GLP-1 and dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists is another strategy to help use these hormones to improve blood glucose management in people with type 2 diabetes.\\n\\nThese medications have similar effects to the GLP-1 and GIP produced in the body but are resistant to being broken down by the DPP-4 enzyme. These medications can result in large benefits on lowering blood glucose and body weight. Some agents in this class have also been shown to prevent heart disease. Most of these medications are injected, with the exception of one that is taken by mouth once daily, called semaglutide (Rybelsus).\\n\\nInjectable GLP-1 receptor agonists currently on the market include:\\n\\n- Dulaglutide (Trulicity)\\n- Exenatide (Byetta)\\n- Exenatide extended-release (Bydureon)\\n- Liraglutide (Victoza)\\n- Lixisenatide (Adlyxin)\\n- Injectable semaglutide (Ozempic)\\n\\nOne dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist is currently on the market called tirzepatide (Mounjaro). How often you need to inject these medications varies from twice daily to once weekly, depending on the medication. The most common side effect with these medications is nausea and vomiting, which is more common when starting or increasing the dose.\\n\\n### SGLT2 Inhibitors\\n\\nGlucose in the bloodstream passes through the kidneys where it can either be excreted in the urine or reabsorbed back into the blood. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) works in the kidney to reabsorb glucose. A new class of medication, SGLT2 inhibitors, block this action, causing excess glucose to be eliminated in the urine.\\n\\nBy increasing the amount of glucose excreted in the urine, people can see improved blood glucose, some weight loss, and small decreases in blood pressure. Bexagliflozin (Brenzavvy), canagliflozin (Invokana), dapagliflozin (Farxiga), and empagliflozin (Jardiance) are SGLT2 inhibitors that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat type 2 diabetes. SGLT2 inhibitors are also known to help improve outcomes in people with heart disease, kidney disease, and heart failure.\\n\\nFor this reason, these medications are often used in people with type 2 diabetes who also have heart or kidney problems. Because they increase glucose levels in the urine, the most common side effects include genital yeast infections.\\n\\n### Sulfonylureas\\n\\nSulfonylureas have been in use since the 1950s and they stimulate beta cells in the pancreas to release more insulin. There are three main sulfonylurea drugs used today, glimepiride (Amaryl), glipizide (Glucotrol and Glucotrol XL), and glyburide (Micronase, Glynase, and Diabeta). These drugs are generally taken one to two times a day before meals.\\n\\nAll sulfonylurea drugs have similar effects on blood glucose levels, but they differ in side effects, how often they are taken, and interactions with other drugs. The most common side effects with sulfonylureas are low blood glucose and weight gain.\\n\\n### TZDs\\n\\nRosiglitazone (Avandia) and pioglitazone (Actos) are in a group of drugs called thiazolidinediones. These drugs help insulin work better in the muscle and fat and reduce glucose production in the liver.\\n\\nA benefit of TZDs is that they lower blood glucose without having a high risk for causing low blood glucose. Both drugs in this class can increase the risk for heart failure in some individuals and can also cause fluid retention (edema) in the legs and feet.\\n\\n## Less Commonly Used Medications\\n\\nIn addition to the commonly used classes discussed above, there are other less commonly used medications that can work well for some people:\\n\\n- Alpha glucosidase inhibitors\\n- Bile acid sequestrants\\n- Dopamine-2 agonists\\n- Meglitinides\\n\\n### Alpha-Glucosidase Inhibitors\\n\\nAcarbose (Precose) and miglitol (Glyset) are alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. These drugs help the body lower blood glucose levels by blocking the breakdown of starches, such as bread, potatoes, and pasta in the intestine. By slowing the breakdown of these foods, this slows the rise in blood glucose levels after a meal. These medications should be taken with the first bite of each meal, so they need to be taken multiple times daily. Based on how these medications work, they commonly cause gastrointestinal side effects including gas and diarrhea.\\n\\n### Bile Acid Sequestrants (BASs)\\n\\nThe BAS colesevelam (Welchol) is a cholesterol-lowering medication that also reduces blood glucose levels in people with diabetes. BASs help remove cholesterol from the body, particularly LDL cholesterol, which is often elevated in people with diabetes. The medications reduce LDL cholesterol by binding with bile acids in the digestive system. The body in turn uses cholesterol to replace the bile acids, which lowers cholesterol levels.\\n\\nThe mechanism by which colesevelam lowers glucose levels is not well understood. Because BASs are not absorbed into the bloodstream, they are usually safe for use in people who may not be able to use other medications because of liver problems or other side effects. Because of the way they work, side effects of BASs can include flatulence and constipation, and they can interact with the absorption of other medications taken at the same time.\\n\\n### Dopamine-2 Agonists\\n\\nBromocriptine (Cycloset) is a dopamine-2 agonist that is approved by the FDA to lower blood glucose in people with type 2 diabetes. Bromocriptine is taken once daily in the morning. A common side effect is nausea.\\n\\n### Meglitinides\\n\\nMeglitinides are drugs that also stimulate beta cells to release insulin. Nateglinide (Starlix) and repaglinide (Prandin) are both meglitinides. They are taken before each meal to help lower glucose after you eat. Because meglitinides stimulate the release of insulin, it is possible to have low blood glucose when taking these medications.\\n\\n## Combination Therapy\\n\\nBecause the drugs listed above act in different ways to lower blood glucose levels, they may be used together to help meet your individualized diabetes goals. For example, metformin and a DPP-4 inhibitor may be used together shortly after being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes to help keep blood glucose levels at goal. That said, many combinations can be used. Work with your health care provider to find the combination of medicines that work best for you and your lifestyle and help you meet your health goals.\\n\\n[Insulin may also be used to treat type 2 diabetes](https://diabetes.org/health-wellness/medication/insulin-basics).\\n\\n## Is There a Danger of Interactions?\\n\\nIn general, diabetes medications are safe and work well. But like any other medication, they must be used with care.\\n\\nDiabetes medications can interact with other medications. Because of the chance of these interactions, you need to tell your doctor about everything you are taking, including over-the-counter medications and vitamins and other supplements. While you're taking diabetes medications, you should also check with your doctor before starting anything new—even over-the-counter items.\",\n      \"summary\": \"{\\\"answer\\\":\\\"The provided text discusses various medications for type 2 diabetes but does not specify the latest FDA-approved medications for 2023-2024, including GLP-1 agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors.

The tool executed a search and returned two main sources: a Healthline article (last medically reviewed August 2022) and an American Diabetes Association (ADA) page (published July 2024). This synthesis critically evaluates the content provided in relation to the original query.\n\n---\n\n**Main Findings Organized by Themes**\n\n1. **General Overview of Diabetes Medications**\n   - Both sources provide comprehensive overviews of oral and injectable medications for type 2 diabetes, including classes such as metformin, DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, and others.\n   - The ADA source (2024) describes the mechanisms, usage, and common side effects of these medication classes but does not specify new approvals or innovations for 2023-2024.\n\n2. **GLP-1 Agonists and SGLT2 Inhibitors**\n   - GLP-1 agonists listed include dulaglutide (Trulicity), exenatide (Byetta, Bydureon), liraglutide (Victoza), lixisenatide (Adlyxin), and semaglutide (Ozempic, Rybelsus), as well as the dual GLP-1/GIP agonist tirzepatide (Mounjaro).\n   - SGLT2 inhibitors mentioned are bexagliflozin (Brenzavvy), canagliflozin (Invokana), dapagliflozin (Farxiga), and empagliflozin (Jardiance).\n   - The ADA source notes these medications' benefits, such as cardiovascular and renal protection, but does not indicate which (if any) were newly FDA-approved in 2023-2024.\n\n3. **Lack of Recent Approval Data**\n   - Both sources explicitly state the absence of information regarding the latest FDA approvals in 2023-2024 for diabetes medications, including GLP-1 agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors.\n\n---\n\n**Critical Analysis of Evidence Quality**\n\n- **Source Currency:**  \n  - The Healthline article, while updated in August 2022, predates the 2023-2024 window and cannot provide the most recent approval data.\n  - The ADA page is more current (July 2024) but focuses on broad educational content rather than a list of recent FDA approvals.\n\n- **Source Authority:**  \n  - Both Healthline and the ADA are reputable, medically reviewed sources. However, neither is a primary source for FDA approval announcements.\n\n- **Limitations:**  \n  - Neither source fulfills the user's request for a list of the latest FDA approvals (2023-2024).\n  - The information provided is largely descriptive and lacks actionable updates on new drug approvals.\n\n---\n\n**Synthesis of Key Insights and Patterns**\n\n- The sources confirm that GLP-1 agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors remain central to modern diabetes management and that several agents in these classes are widely used.\n- There is a notable gap in the information: neither source provides a list or discussion of medications newly approved by the FDA in 2023-2024.\n- The ADA source does mention bexagliflozin (Brenzavvy), which is a relatively recent SGLT2 inhibitor, but does not clarify its approval date or contextualize it among other recent approvals.\n\n---\n\n**Limitations and Gaps Identified**\n\n- **Primary Limitation:**  \n  - Absence of specific, up-to-date information on FDA approvals for diabetes medications in 2023-2024.\n- **Secondary Limitation:**  \n  - Lack of differentiation between established and newly approved medications within the GLP-1 agonist and SGLT2 inhibitor classes.\n- **Potential for Outdated Information:**  \n  - Reliance on secondary summaries rather than direct FDA or peer-reviewed primary sources.\n\n---\n\n**Evidence-Based Conclusions**\n\n- The tool output does not satisfy the user's request for a list of the latest FDA-approved diabetes medications for 2023-2024, particularly within the GLP-1 agonist and SGLT2 inhibitor categories.\n- The information provided is accurate for a general overview but insufficient for users seeking recent regulatory updates.\n\n---\n\n**Future Research Directions**\n\n- To address the user's request, consult the FDA's official \"New Drug Approvals\" listings, recent press releases, or pharmaceutical industry updates for 2023-2024.\n- Systematic review of clinical trial registries and recent publications may identify emerging therapies or newly approved agents in the diabetes space.\n- Further synthesis should prioritize primary, authoritative sources (e.g., FDA, EMA, peer-reviewed journals) for the most current approval data.\n\n---\n\n**Highlighted Issues/Errors**\n\n- **Critical Gap:** The search did not yield the latest FDA approval information for diabetes medications in 2023-2024.\n- **User Guidance:** For up-to-date and authoritative information on new diabetes drug approvals, direct consultation of the FDA website or recent endocrinology conference proceedings is recommended.

They should also be taught how to modify the insulin dose (correction dose) based on concurrent glycemia, glycemic trends (if available), sick-day management, and anticipated physical activity. **B**\\n\\n- **9.6** Glucagon should be prescribed for all individuals taking insulin or at high risk for hypoglycemia. Family, caregivers, school personnel, and others providing support to these individuals should know its location and be educated on how to administer it. Glucagon preparations that do not require reconstitution are preferred. **E**\\n\\n- **9.7** Insulin treatment plan and insulin-taking behavior should be reevaluated at regular intervals (e.g., every 3–6 months) and adjusted to incorporate specific factors that impact choice of treatment and ensure achievement of individualized glycemic goals. **E**\\n\\n\\n### Insulin Therapy\\n\\nInsulin treatment is essential for individuals with type 1 diabetes because the hallmark of type 1 diabetes is absent or near-absent β-cell function. In addition to hyperglycemia, insulinopenia can contribute to other metabolic disturbances like hypertriglyceridemia and ketoacidosis as well as tissue catabolism that can be life threatening. Severe metabolic decompensation can be, and was, mostly prevented with once- or twice-daily injections for the six or seven decades after the discovery of insulin. Over the past four decades, evidence has accumulated supporting more intensive insulin replacement, using multiple daily injections of insulin or continuous subcutaneous administration through an insulin pump, as providing the best combination of effectiveness and safety for people with type 1 diabetes.\\n\\nThe Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) demonstrated that intensive therapy with multiple daily injections or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) reduced A1C and was associated with improved long-term outcomes ( [1](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B1)– [3](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B3)). The study was carried out with short-acting (regular) and intermediate-acting (NPH) human insulins. In this landmark trial, lower A1C with intensive control (7%) led to ∼50% reductions in microvascular complications over 6 years of treatment. However, intensive therapy was associated with a higher rate of severe hypoglycemia than conventional treatment (62 compared with 19 episodes per 100 patient-years of therapy) ( [1](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B1)). Follow-up of participants from the DCCT demonstrated fewer macrovascular and microvascular complications in the group that received intensive treatment. Achieving intensive glycemic goals during the active treatment period of the study had a beneficial impact over the 20 years after the active treatment component of the study ended ( [1](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B1)– [3](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B3)).\\n\\nInsulin replacement plans typically consist of basal insulin, mealtime insulin, and correction insulin ( [4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B4)). Basal insulin includes NPH insulin, long-acting insulin analogs, and continuous delivery of rapid-acting insulin via an insulin pump. Basal insulin analogs have longer duration of action with flatter, more constant and consistent plasma concentrations and activity profiles than NPH insulin; rapid-acting analogs (RAA) have a quicker onset and peak and shorter duration of action than regular human insulin. In people with type 1 diabetes, treatment with analog insulins is associated with less hypoglycemia and weight gain as well as lower A1C compared with injectable human insulins ( [5](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B5)– [7](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B7)). More recently, two injectable ultra-rapid-acting analog (URAA) insulin formulations were developed to accelerate absorption and provide more activity in the first portion of their profile compared with the other RAA ( [8](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B8), [9](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B9)). Inhaled human insulin has a rapid peak and shortened duration of action compared with RAA ( [10](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B10)) (see also subsection alternative insulin routes in pharmacologic therapy for adults with type 2diabetes). These newer formulations may cause less hypoglycemia, while improving postprandial glucose excursions and administration flexibility (in relation to prandial intake), compared with RAA ( [10](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B10)– [12](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B12)). In addition, longer-acting basal analogs (U-300 glargine or degludec) may confer a lower hypoglycemia risk compared with U-100 glargine in individuals with type 1 diabetes ( [13](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B13), [14](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B14)).\\n\\nDespite the advantages of insulin analogs in individuals with type 1 diabetes, the expense and/or intensity of treatment required for their use may be prohibitive. There are multiple approaches to insulin treatment. The central precept in the management of type 1 diabetes is that some form of insulin be given in a defined treatment plan tailored to the individual to prevent diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and minimize clinically relevant hypoglycemia while achieving the individual’s glycemic goals. The impact of the introduction of interchangeable biosimilars and unbranded versions of some analog products as well as current and upcoming price reductions on insulin access need to be evaluated. Reassessment of insulin-taking behavior and adjustment of treatment plans to account for specific factors, including cost, that impact choice of treatment is recommended at regular intervals (every 3–6 months).\\n\\nMost studies comparing multiple daily injections with CSII have been relatively small and of short duration. A systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that CSII via pump therapy has modest advantages for lowering A1C (−0.30% \\\\[95% CI −0.58 to −0.02\\\\]) and for reducing severe hypoglycemia rates in children and adults ( [15](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B15)). Use of CSII is associated with improvement in quality of life, particularly in areas related to fear of hypoglycemia and diabetes distress, compared with multiple daily injections of insulin ( [16](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B16), [17](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B17)). However, there is no consensus to guide the choice of injection or pump therapy in a given individual, and research to guide this decision-making is needed ( [4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B4)). Integration of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) into the treatment plan soon after diagnosis improves glycemic outcomes, decreases hypoglycemic events, and improves quality of life for individuals with type 1 diabetes ( [18](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B18)– [23](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B23)). Its use is now considered standard of care for most people with type 1 diabetes ( [4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B4)) (see Section 7, “ [Diabetes Technology](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S007)”). Reduction of nocturnal hypoglycemia in individuals with type 1 diabetes using insulin pumps with CGM is improved by automatic suspension of insulin delivery at a preset glucose level, with further improvements when using devices with predictive low glucose insulin delivery suspension ( [24](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B24), [25](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B25)).\\n\\nAutomated insulin delivery (AID) systems are safe and effective for people with type 1 diabetes. Randomized controlled trials and real-world studies have demonstrated the ability of commercially available systems to improve achievement of glycemic goals while reducing the risk of hypoglycemia ( [26](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B26)– [31](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B31)). Data are emerging on the safety and effectiveness of do-it-yourself systems ( [32](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B32), [33](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B33)). Evidence suggests that an AID hybrid closed-loop system is superior to AID sensor-augmented pump therapy for increased percentage of time in range and reduction of hypoglycemia ( [34](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B34), [35](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B35)).\\n\\nIntensive insulin management using a version of CSII and CGM should be considered in individuals with type 1 diabetes whenever feasible. AID systems are preferred and should be considered for individuals with type 1 diabetes who are capable of using the device safely (either by themselves or with a caregiver) to improve time in range and reduce A1C and hypoglycemia ( [26](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B26), [28](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B28)– [31](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B31), [36](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B36)– [42](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B42)). When choosing among insulin delivery systems, individual preferences, cost, insulin type, dosing plan, and self-management capabilities should be considered. See Section 7, “ [Diabetes Technology](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S007),” for a full discussion of insulin delivery devices.\\n\\nIn general, individuals with type 1 diabetes require approximately 30–50% of their daily insulin as basal and the remainder as prandial ( [43](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B43)). This proportion is dependent on a number of factors, including but not limited to carbohydrate consumption, age, pregnancy status, and puberty stage ( [4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B4), [44](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B44)– [48](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B48)). Total daily insulin requirements can be estimated based on weight, with typical doses ranging from 0.4 to 1.0 units/kg/day. Higher amounts may be required during puberty, menses, and medical illness. The _American Diabetes Association/JDRF Type 1 Diabetes Sourcebook_ notes 0.5 units/kg/day as a typical starting dose in adults with type 1 diabetes who are metabolically stable, with approximately one-half administered as prandial insulin given to manage blood glucose after meals and the remaining portion as basal insulin to manage glycemia in the periods between meal absorption ( [49](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B49)). Starting doses and those soon after diagnosis may be higher, if an individual presents with ketoacidosis, or lower (0.2–0.6 units/kg), particularly in young children and those with continued endogenous insulin production (during the partial remission phase or “honeymoon period,” or in people who present with type 1 diabetes in adulthood) ( [49](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B49)– [52](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B52)). This guideline provides detailed information on intensification of therapy to meet individualized needs. In addition, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) position statement “Type 1 Diabetes Management Through the Life Span” provides a thorough overview of type 1 diabetes treatment ( [53](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B53)).\\n\\nTypical multidose treatment plans for individuals with type 1 diabetes combine premeal use of prandial insulins with a longer-acting formulation. The long-acting basal dose is titrated to regulate overnight and fasting glucose. Postprandial glucose excursions are best managed by a well-timed injection or inhalation of prandial insulin. Prandial insulin should ideally be administered prior to meal consumption; however, the optimal time to administer varies based on the pharmacokinetics of the formulation (regular, RAA, or inhaled), the premeal blood glucose level, and carbohydrate consumption. Recommendations for prandial insulin dose administration should therefore be individualized. Physiologic insulin secretion varies with glycemia, meal size, meal composition, and tissue demands for glucose. To approach this variability in people using insulin treatment, strategies have evolved to adjust prandial doses based on predicted needs. Thus, education on how to adjust prandial insulin to account for nutritional intake and the correction dose based on premeal glucose levels, anticipated activity, and sick-day management can be effective and should be offered to most individuals ( [54](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B54)– [59](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B59)). Education regarding adjustment of prandial insulin dose for glycemic trends should be provided to individuals who are using CGM alone or an AID system ( [60](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B60)– [63](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B63)). Further adjustment of prandial insulin doses for nutritional intake of protein and fat, in addition to carbohydrates, is recommended but may be more feasible for individuals using CSII than for those using multiple daily injections ( [56](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B56)). With some AID systems, use of a simplified meal announcement method may be an alternative for prandial insulin dosing ( [31](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B31), [64](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B64)) (see Section 5, “ [Facilitating Positive Health Behaviors and Well-being to Improve Health Outcomes](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S005),” and Section 7, “ [Diabetes Technology](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S007)”).\\n\\nDue to the risk of hypoglycemia with insulin treatment, all individuals with type 1 diabetes should be prescribed glucagon. Individuals with type 1 diabetes and/or those in close contact with individuals with type 1 diabetes should be educated on the use and administration of the individual’s prescribed glucagon product. The glucagon product available to individuals may differ based on coverage and cost, however those that do not require reconstitution are preferred for ease of administration ( [65](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B65), [66](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B66)). Clinicians should routinely review the individual’s access to glucagon, as appropriate glucagon prescribing is low ( [67](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B67), [68](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B68)). See Section 6, “ [Glycemic Goals and Hypoglycemia](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S006),” for additional information on hypoglycemia and glucagon in individuals with diabetes. The 2021 ADA/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) consensus report on the management of type 1 diabetes in adults summarizes different insulin plans and glucose monitoring strategies in individuals with type 1 diabetes ( **[Fig. 9.1](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.1)** and **[Table 9.1](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T9.1)**) ( [4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B4)).\\n\\n#### Figure 9.1.\\n\\nChoices of insulin plans in people with type 1 diabetes.

Inhaled insulin may be used in place of injectable prandial insulin in the U.S. 1The number of plus signs (+) is an estimate of relative association of the plan with increased flexibility, lower risk of hypoglycemia, and higher costs between the considered plans.

( [4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B4)).\\n\\n#### Table 9.1.\\n\\nExamples of subcutaneous insulin treatment plans\\n\\n| Plans | Timing and distribution | Advantages | Disadvantages | Adjusting doses |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| Plans that more closely mimic normal insulin secretion |\\n| Insulin pump therapy (also including AID systems: hybrid closed-loop, low-glucose suspend, CGM-augmented open-loop, BGM-augmented open-loop) | Basal delivery of URAA or RAA; generally 30–50% of TDD.

Flexibility in meal timing and content. Pump can deliver insulin in increments of fractions of units. Potential for integration with CGM for AID systems. TIR % highest and TBR % lowest with: hybrid closed-loop > low-glucose suspend > CGM-augmented open-loop > BGM-augmented open-loop. | Most expensive plan. Must continuously wear one or more devices. Risk of rapid development of ketosis or DKA with interruption of insulin delivery. Potential reactions to adhesives and site infections.

Thus, it is important that insulin be delivered into the proper tissue in the correct way. Recommendations have been published elsewhere outlining best practices for insulin administration ( [69](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B69)). Proper insulin administration technique includes injection or infusion (for CSII or AID systems) into appropriate body areas, injection or infusion site rotation, appropriate care of injection or infusion sites to avoid infection or other complications, and avoidance of intramuscular (IM) insulin delivery. Selection of method of administration (vial and syringe, insulin pen, connected insulin pens/devices, or insulin pumps) will depend on a variety of individual-specific factors and needs, cost and coverage, and individual preferences. Reassessment of the appropriate administration technique via whichever method is used should be completed during routine follow-up.\\n\\nExogenously delivered insulin should be injected into subcutaneous tissue, not intramuscularly. Recommended sites for insulin administration include the abdomen, thigh, buttock, and upper arm. Insulin absorption from IM sites differs from that in subcutaneous sites and is also influenced by the activity of the muscle. Inadvertent IM injection can lead to unpredictable insulin absorption and variable effects on glucose and is associated with frequent and unexplained hypoglycemia. Risk for IM insulin delivery is increased in younger, leaner individuals when injecting into the limbs rather than truncal sites (abdomen and buttocks) and when using longer needles. Recent evidence supports the use of short needles (e.g., 4-mm pen needles) as effective and well tolerated when compared with longer needles, including a study performed in adults with obesity ( [70](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B70)).\\n\\nInjection or infusion site rotation is additionally necessary to avoid lipohypertrophy, an accumulation of subcutaneous fat in response to the adipogenic actions of insulin at a site of multiple injections. Lipohypertrophy appears as soft, smooth raised areas several centimeters in breadth and can contribute to erratic insulin absorption, increased glycemic variability, and unexplained hypoglycemic episodes. People treated with insulin and/or caregivers should receive education about proper injection or infusion site rotation and how to recognize and avoid areas of lipohypertrophy. As noted in **[Table 4.1](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S004)**, examination of insulin injection sites for the presence of lipohypertrophy, as well as assessment of administration device use and injection technique, are key components of a comprehensive diabetes medical evaluation and treatment plan. Proper insulin injection or infusion technique may lead to more effective use of this therapy and, as such, holds the potential for improved clinical outcomes.\\n\\n### Noninsulin Treatments for Type 1 Diabetes\\n\\nInjectable and oral glucose-lowering medications have been studied for their efficacy as adjunct to insulin treatment of type 1 diabetes. Pramlintide is based on the naturally occurring β-cell peptide amylin and is approved for use in adults with type 1 diabetes. Clinical trials have demonstrated a modest reduction in A1C (0.3–0.4%) and modest weight loss (∼1 kg) with pramlintide ( [71](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B71)). Similar results have been reported for several agents currently approved only for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The addition of metformin in adults with type 1 diabetes was associated with small reductions in body weight, insulin dose, and lipid levels but did not sustainably improve A1C ( [72](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B72), [73](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B73)). The largest clinical trials of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) in type 1 diabetes have been conducted with liraglutide 1.8 mg daily, and results showed modest A1C reductions (∼0.4%), decreases in weight (∼5 kg), and reductions in insulin doses ( [74](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B74), [75](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B75)). Similarly, sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been studied in clinical trials in people with type 1 diabetes, and results showed improvements in A1C, reduced body weight, and improved blood pressure ( [76](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B76)); however, SGLT2 inhibitor use in type 1 diabetes was associated with an increased rate of DKA. The SGLT1/2 inhibitor sotagliflozin has been studied in clinical trials in people with type 1 diabetes, and results showed improvements in A1C and body weight ( [77](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B77)); however, sotagliflozin use was associated with an eightfold increase in DKA compared with placebo ( [78](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B78)). The studies that led to the approved indication for heart failure (HF) excluded individuals with type 1 diabetes or a history of DKA ( [79](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B79), [80](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B80)). See section prevention and treatment of heart failure within Section 10, “ [Cardiovascular Disease and Risk Management](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S010),” for information on risk mitigation with the use of SGLT inhibitors in those with type 1 diabetes. The risks and benefits of adjunctive agents continue to be evaluated, with consensus statements providing guidance on patient selection and precautions ( [81](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B81)).\\n\\nThere are currently no approved therapies for preservation of C-peptide or delaying the progression of clinical type 1 diabetes. Higher C-peptide levels have been associated with better A1C, lower risk of retinopathy, lower risk of nephropathy, and lower risk of severe hypoglycemia ( [82](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B82)). Several therapies, including verapamil and monoclonal antibodies, are currently under active investigation.\\n\\n## Surgical Treatment for Type 1 Diabetes\\n\\n### Pancreas and Islet Transplantation\\n\\nSuccessful pancreas and islet transplantation can normalize glucose levels and mitigate microvascular complications of type 1 diabetes. However, people receiving these treatments require lifelong immunosuppression to prevent graft rejection and/or recurrence of autoimmune islet destruction. Given the potential adverse effects of immunosuppressive therapy, pancreas transplantation should be reserved for people with type 1 diabetes undergoing simultaneous kidney transplantation, following kidney transplantation, or for those with recurrent ketoacidosis or severe hypoglycemia despite intensive glycemic management ( [83](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B83)). In much of the world, allogenic islet transplantation is regulated as an organ transplant. However, in the U.S., allogenic islet transplantation is regulated as a cell therapy, and the first such allogeneic islet cell therapy, donislecel-jujn, was approved in 2023. Donislecel is indicated for the treatment of adults with type 1 diabetes who are unable to approach their A1C goal because of current repeated episodes of severe hypoglycemia despite intensive diabetes management and education.\\n\\nThe 2021 ADA/EASD consensus report on the management of type 1 diabetes in adults offers a simplified overview of indications for β-cell replacement therapy in people with type 1 diabetes ( **[Fig. 9.2](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.2)**) ( [4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B4)).\\n\\n#### Figure 9.2.\\n\\nSimplified overview of indications for β-cell replacement therapy in people with type 1 diabetes. The two main forms of β-cell replacement therapy are whole-pancreas transplantation or islet cell transplantation. β-Cell replacement therapy can be combined with kidney transplantation if the individual has end-stage renal disease, which may be performed simultaneously or after kidney transplantation.

however, the glycemic benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors are reduced at eGFR <45 mL/min per 1.73 m2 (see Section 11, “ [Chronic Kidney Disease and Risk Management](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S011)” for details on renal risk reduction recommendations). **A**\\n\\n- **9.21** In adults with type 2 diabetes and advanced CKD (eGFR <30 mL/min per 1.73 m2), a GLP-1 RA is preferred for glycemic management due to lower risk of hypoglycemia and for cardiovascular event reduction. **B**\\n\\n- **9.22** In adults with type 2 diabetes, initiation of insulin should be considered regardless of background glucose-lowering therapy or disease stage if there is evidence of ongoing catabolism (e.g., unexpected weight loss), if symptoms of hyperglycemia are present, or when A1C or blood glucose levels are very high (i.e., A1C >10% \\\\[>86 mmol/mol\\\\] or blood glucose ≥300 mg/dL \\\\[≥16.7 mmol/L\\\\]). **E**\\n\\n- **9.23** In adults with type 2 diabetes, a GLP-1 RA, including a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 RA, is preferred to insulin ( **[Fig. 9.4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.4)**). **A**\\n\\n- **9.24** If insulin is used, combination therapy with a GLP-1 RA, including a dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, is recommended for greater glycemic effectiveness as well as beneficial effects on weight and hypoglycemia risk for adults with type 2 diabetes. Insulin dosing should be reassessed upon addition or dose escalation of a GLP-1 RA or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA. **A**\\n\\n- **9.25** In adults with type 2 diabetes, glucose-lowering agents may be continued upon initiation of insulin therapy (unless contraindicated or not tolerated) for ongoing glycemic and metabolic benefits (i.e., weight, cardiometabolic, or kidney benefits). **A**\\n\\n- **9.26** To minimize the risk of hypoglycemia and treatment burden when starting insulin therapy in adults with type 2 diabetes, reassess the need for and/or dose of glucose-lowering agents with higher hypoglycemia risk (i.e., sulfonylureas and meglitinides). **A**\\n\\n- **9.27** Monitor for signs of overbasalization during insulin therapy, such as basal dose exceeding ∼0.5 units/kg/day, significant bedtime-to-morning or postprandial-to-preprandial glucose differential, occurrences of hypoglycemia (aware or unaware), and high glycemic variability. When overbasalization is suspected, a thorough reevaluation should occur promptly to further tailor therapy to the individual’s needs. **E**\\n\\n- **9.28** Routinely assess all people with diabetes for financial obstacles that could impede their diabetes management.

Person-specific factors that affect choice of treatment include individualized glycemic goals (see Section 6, “ [Glycemic Goals and Hypoglycemia](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S006)”), individualized weight goals, the individual’s risk for hypoglycemia, and the individual’s history of or risk factors for cardiovascular, kidney, liver, and other comorbidities and complications of diabetes (see Section 4, “ [Comprehensive Medical Evaluation and Assessment of Comorbidities](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S004),” Section 10, “ [Cardiovascular Disease and Risk Management](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S010),” and Section 11 “ [Chronic Kidney Disease and Risk Management](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S011)”). In addition, treatment decisions must consider the tolerability and side effect profiles of medications, complexity of the medication plan and the individual’s capacity to implement it given their specific situation and context, and the access, cost, and availability of medication. Lifestyle modifications and health behaviors that improve health (see Section 5, “ [Facilitating Positive Health Behaviors and Well-being to Improve Health Outcomes](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S005)”) should be emphasized along with any pharmacologic therapy. Section 13, “ [Older Adults](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S013),” and Section 14, “ [Children and Adolescents](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S014),” have recommendations specific for older adults and for children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes, respectively. Section 10, “ [Cardiovascular Disease and Risk Management](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S010),” and Section 11, “ [Chronic Kidney Disease and Risk Management](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S011),” have recommendations for the use of glucose-lowering drugs in the management of cardiovascular disease and kidney disease, respectively.\\n\\n### Choice of Glucose-Lowering Therapy\\n\\nHealthy lifestyle behaviors, diabetes self-management, education, and support, avoidance of clinical inertia, and social determinants of health should be considered in the glucose-lowering management of type 2 diabetes. Pharmacologic therapy should be guided by person-centered treatment factors, including comorbidities and treatment goals and preferences. Pharmacotherapy should be started at the time type 2 diabetes is diagnosed unless there are contraindications. Pharmacologic approaches that provide the efficacy to achieve treatment goals should be considered, such as metformin or other agents, including combination therapy, that provide adequate efficacy to achieve and maintain treatment goals ( [84](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B84)). In adults with type 2 diabetes and established/high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), HF, and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD), the treatment plan should include agents that reduce cardiovascular and kidney disease risk (see **[Fig. 9.3](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.3)**, **[Table 9.2](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T9.2)**, Section 10, “ [Cardiovascular Disease and Risk Management](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S010),” and Section 11, “ [Chronic Kidney Disease and Risk Management](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S011)”). In general, higher-efficacy approaches have greater likelihood of achieving glycemic goals, with the following considered to have very high efficacy for glucose lowering: the GLP-1 RAs dulaglutide (high dose) and semaglutide, the dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 RA tirzepatide, insulin, combination oral therapy, and combination injectable therapy. Weight management is a distinct treatment goal, along with glycemic management, in individuals with type 2 diabetes, as it has multifaceted benefits, including improved glycemic management, reduction in hepatic steatosis, and improvement in cardiovascular risk factors ( [84](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B84)– [86](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B86)). The glucose-lowering treatment plan should therefore consider approaches that support weight management goals, with semaglutide and tirzepatide currently having the highest weight loss efficacy among agents approved for glycemic management ( **[Fig. 9.3](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.3)** and **[Table 9.2](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T9.2)**) ( [84](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B84), [87](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B87), [88](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B88)). Additional weight management approaches, alone or in combination, should be used if needed to achieve individual goals (i.e., intensive behavioral management programs, weight loss pharmacotherapies, or metabolic surgery). See Section 8, “ [Obesity and Weight Management](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S008),” for approaches to achieve weight management goals.\\n\\nMetformin is effective and safe, is inexpensive and widely available, and may reduce risk of cardiovascular events and death ( [89](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B89)). Metformin is available in an immediate-release form for twice-daily dosing or as an extended-release form that can be given once daily. Compared with sulfonylureas, metformin as first-line therapy has beneficial effects on A1C, is weight neutral, does not cause hypoglycemia, and reduces cardiovascular mortality ( [90](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B90)).\\n\\nThe principal side effects of metformin are gastrointestinal intolerance due to bloating, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea; these can be mitigated by gradual dose titration and/or using extended-release formulation. The drug is cleared by renal filtration, and very high circulating levels (e.g., as a result of overdose or acute renal failure) have been associated with lactic acidosis. However, the occurrence of this complication is now known to be very rare, and metformin may be safely used in people with estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2 ( [91](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B91)). A randomized trial confirmed previous observations that metformin use is associated with vitamin B12 deficiency and worsening of symptoms of neuropathy ( [92](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B92)). This is compatible with a report from the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) suggesting periodic testing of vitamin B12 levels ( [93](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B93)) (see Section 3, “ [Prevention or Delay of Diabetes and Associated Comorbidities](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S003)”) in individuals treated with metformin for an extended period of time.\\n\\nWhen A1C is ≥1.5% above the individualized glycemic goal (see Section 6, “ [Glycemic Goals and Hypoglycemia](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S006),” for appropriate goals), many individuals will require dual-combination therapy or a more potent glucose-lowering agent to achieve and maintain their goal A1C level ( [84](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B84), [94](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B94)) ( **[Fig. 9.3](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.3)** and **[Table 9.2](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T9.2)**). Insulin has the advantage of being effective where other agents are not and should be considered as part of any combination medication plan when hyperglycemia is severe, especially if catabolic features (weight loss, hypertriglyceridemia, ketosis) are present. It is common practice to initiate insulin therapy for people who present with blood glucose levels ≥300 mg/dL (≥16.7 mmol/L) or A1C >10% (>86 mmol/mol) or if the individual has symptoms of hyperglycemia (i.e., polyuria or polydipsia) or evidence of catabolism (unexpected weight loss) ( **[Fig. 9.4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.4)**). As glucose toxicity resolves, simplifying the medication plan and/or changing to noninsulin agents is often possible. However, there is evidence that people with poorly managed hyperglycemia associated with type 2 diabetes can also be effectively treated with a sulfonylurea, GLP-1 RA, or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA ( [87](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B87), [88](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B88), [95](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B95)). GLP-1 RAs and tirzepatide have additional benefits over insulin and sulfonylureas, specifically lower risk for hypoglycemia (both) and favorable weight (both), cardiovascular (GLP-1 RAs), and kidney (GLP-1 RAs) end points.\\n\\n### Combination Therapy\\n\\nBecause type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease in many individuals, maintenance of glycemic goals often requires combination therapy. Traditional recommendations have been to use stepwise addition of medications to metformin to maintain goal A1C. The advantage of this is to provide a clear assessment of the positive and negative effects of new drugs and reduce potential side effects and expense ( [96](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B96)). However, there are data to support initial combination therapy for more rapid attainment of glycemic goals ( [97](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B97), [98](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B98)) and later combination therapy for longer durability of glycemic effect ( [99](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B99)). The VERIFY (Vildagliptin Efficacy in combination with metformin For earlY treatment of type 2 diabetes) trial demonstrated that initial combination therapy—in this case of metformin and the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor vildagliptin—is superior to sequential addition of medications for extending primary and secondary failure ( [100](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B100)). Initial combination therapy should be considered in people presenting with A1C levels 1.5–2.0% above goal. Finally, incorporation of high-glycemic-efficacy therapies or therapies for cardiovascular and kidney disease risk reduction (e.g., GLP-1 RAs, dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, and SGLT2 inhibitors) may allow for weaning of the current medication plan, particularly of agents that may increase the risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain. Thus, treatment intensification may not necessarily follow a pure sequential addition of therapy but instead reflect a tailoring of the medication plan in alignment with person-centered treatment goals and pursuit of multifaceted treatment goals ( **[Fig. 9.3](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.3)**).\\n\\nTreatment intensification, deintensification, or modification—as appropriate—for people not meeting individualized treatment goals should not be delayed. Shared decision-making is important in discussions regarding treatment change. The choice of medication added to initial therapy is based on the clinical characteristics of the individual and their preferences and goals for care. Important clinical characteristics include the presence of overweight or obesity, established ASCVD or indicators of high ASCVD risk, HF, CKD, obesity, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, hypoglycemia, and risk for specific adverse drug effects, as well as safety, tolerability, accessibility, usability, and cost. Results from comparative effectiveness meta-analyses suggest that each new class of oral noninsulin agents added to initial therapy with metformin generally lowers A1C approximately 0.7–1.0% (8–11 mmol/mol); if a GLP-1 RA or the dual GIP and GLP-1 RA is added, a 1 to ≥2% lowering in A1C is expected ( [87](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B87), [101](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B101), [102](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B102)) ( **[Fig. 9.3](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.3)** and **[Table 9.2](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T9.2)**).\\n\\nFor people with type 2 diabetes and established ASCVD or indicators of high ASCVD risk, HF, or CKD, an SGLT2 inhibitor and/or GLP-1 RA with demonstrated cardiovascular benefit (see **[Table 9.2](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T9.2)**, **Table 10.3 _B_**, and **Table 10.3 _C_**) is recommended as part of the glucose-lowering plan independent of A1C, independent of metformin use, and in consideration of person-specific factors ( **[Fig. 9.3](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.3)**). Individuals with these comorbidities already achieving their individualized glycemic goals with other medications may benefit from switching to these preferred medications, if possible, to reduce risk of ASCVD, HF, and/or CKD in addition to achieving glycemic goals (see Section 10, “ [Cardiovascular Disease and Risk Management](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S010)” and Section 11, “ [Chronic Kidney Disease and Risk Management](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S011)”). This is particularly important as SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RA are associated with lower risk of hypoglycemia and individuals with ASCVD, HF, and CKD experience heightened hypoglycemia risk.\\n\\nFor people without established ASCVD, indicators of high ASCVD risk, HF, or CKD, medication choice is guided by efficacy in support of individualized glycemic and weight management goals, avoidance of side effects (particularly hypoglycemia and weight gain), cost/access, and individual preferences ( [103](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B103)). A systematic review and network meta-analysis suggests that the greatest reductions in A1C level are with insulin plans, specific GLP-1 RAs (particularly semaglutide), and tirzepatide ( [87](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B87), [88](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B88), [104](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B104)). In all cases, treatment plans need to be continuously reviewed for efficacy, side effects, and burden ( **[Table 9.2](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T9.2)**). In some instances, the individual will require medication reduction or discontinuation. Common reasons for this include ineffectiveness, hypoglycemia, intolerable side effects, new contraindications, expense, or a change in glycemic goals (e.g., in response to development of comorbidities or changes in treatment goals). Section 13, “ [Older Adults](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S013),” has a full discussion of treatment considerations in older adults, in whom changes of glycemic goals and de-escalation of therapy are common.\\n\\nThe need for the greater potency of injectable medications is common, particularly in people with a longer duration of diabetes. The addition of basal insulin, either human NPH or one of the long-acting insulin analogs, to oral agent medication plans is a well-established approach that is effective for many individuals. In addition, evidence supports the utility of GLP-1 RAs in people not attaining their glycemic goals. While most GLP-1 RAs are injectable, an oral formulation of semaglutide is commercially available ( [105](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B105)). In trials comparing the addition of an injectable GLP-1 RA, dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, or insulin in people needing further glucose lowering, glycemic efficacies of injectable GLP-1 RA and dual GIP and GLP-1 RA were similar to or greater than that of basal insulin ( [106](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B106)– [113](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B113)). GLP-1 RAs and dual GIP and GLP-1 RA in these trials had a lower risk of hypoglycemia and beneficial effects on body weight compared with insulin, albeit with greater gastrointestinal side effects. Thus, trial results support high potency GLP-1 RAs and dual GIP and GLP-1 RA as the preferred options for individuals requiring the potency of an injectable therapy for glucose management ( **[Fig. 9.4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.4)**). In individuals who are intensified to insulin therapy, combination therapy with a GLP-1 RA or a dual GIP and GLP-1 RA has been shown to have greater efficacy and durability of glycemic treatment effect, as well as weight and hypoglycemia benefit, than treatment intensification with insulin alone ( [84](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B84), [114](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B114)). However, cost and tolerability issues are important considerations in GLP-1 RA and dual GIP and GLP-1 RA use.\\n\\nCosts for diabetes medications have increased dramatically over the past two decades, and an increasing proportion is now passed on to people with diabetes and their families ( [115](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B115)). **[Table 9.3](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T9.3)** provides cost information for currently approved noninsulin therapies. Of note, prices listed are average wholesale prices (AWP) ( [116](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B116)) and National Average Drug Acquisition Costs (NADAC) ( [117](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B117)), separate measures to allow for a comparison of drug prices, but do not account for discounts, rebates, or other price adjustments often involved in prescription sales that affect the actual cost incurred by the individual. Medication costs can be a major source of stress for people with diabetes and contribute to worse medication-taking behavior ( [118](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B118)); cost-reducing strategies may improve medication-taking behavior in some cases ( [119](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B119)). Although caps on costs are starting to occur for insulin products, no such caps exist for diabetes durable medical equipment or for noninsulin medications. It is therefore essential to screen all people with diabetes for financial concerns and cost-related barriers to care and to engage members of the health care team—including pharmacists, certified diabetes care and education specialists, social workers, community health workers, community paramedics, and others—to identify cost-saving opportunities for medications, diabetes durable medical equipment, and glucagon ( [120](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B120)).\\n\\n#### Table 9.3.\\n\\nMedian monthly (30-day) AWP and NADAC of maximum approved daily dose of noninsulin glucose-lowering agents in the U.S.\\n\\n| Class | Compound(s) | Dosage strength/ product (if applicable) | Median AWP (min, max) [\\\\*](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn5) | Median NADAC (min, max) [\\\\*](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn5) | Maximum approved daily dose [†](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn6) |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| Biguanides | • Metformin | 500 mg (ER) 850 mg (IR) 1,000 mg (IR) 1,000 mg (ER) 500 mg (Sol) | $89 ($45, $6,719) $108 ($5, $189) $87 ($3, $144) $1,884 ($242, $7,214) $405 ($405, $739) | $5 $2 $2 $31 ($31, $226) $535 | 2,000 mg 2,550 mg 2,000 mg 2,000 mg 2,000 mg |\\n| Sulfonylureas (2nd generation) | • Glimepiride • Glipizide • Glyburide | 4 mg 10 mg (IR) 10 mg (XL/ER) 6 mg (micronized) 5 mg | $73 ($72, $198) $72 ($67, $91) $48 ($46, $48) $54 ($48, $71) $82 ($63, $432) | $3 $6 $10 $12 $8 | 8 mg 40 mg 20 mg 12 mg 20 mg |\\n| Thiazolidinedione | • Pioglitazone | 45 mg | $348 ($7, $349) | $4 | 45 mg |\\n| α-Glucosidase inhibitors | • Acarbose • Miglitol | 100 mg 100 mg | $106 ($104, $378) $294 ($241, $346) | $27 NA | 300 mg 300 mg |\\n| Meglitinides | • Nateglinide • Repaglinide | 120 mg 2 mg | $155 $878 ($58, $897) | $27 $31 | 360 mg 16 mg |\\n| DPP-4 inhibitors | • Alogliptin • Linagliptin • Saxagliptin • Sitagliptin | 25 mg 5 mg 5 mg 100 mg | $234 $630 $524 $657 | $161 $504 $466 $525 | 25 mg 5 mg 5 mg 100 mg |\\n| SGLT2 inhibitors | • Canagliflozin • Dapagliflozin • Empagliflozin • Ertugliflozin | 300 mg 10 mg 25 mg 15 mg | $718 $678 $712 $408 | $574 $543 $569 $328 | 300 mg 10 mg 25 mg 15 mg |\\n| GLP-1 RAs | • Dulaglutide | 4.5 mg pen | $1,117 | $895 | 4.5 mg [‡](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn7) |\\n| | • Exenatide | 10 µg pen | $964 | $771 | 20 µg |\\n| | • Exenatide (extended release) | 2 mg pen | $990 | $793 | 2 mg [‡](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn7) |\\n| | • Liraglutide | 1.8 mg pen | $1,340 | $1,072 | 1.8 mg |\\n| | • Semaglutide | 1 mg pen | $1,123 | $903 | 2 mg [‡](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn7) |\\n| | | 14 mg (tablet) | $1,097 ($1,070, $1,123) | $899 | 14 mg |\\n| Dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist | • Tirzepatide | 15 mg pen | $1,228 | $982 | 15 mg [‡](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn7) |\\n| Bile acid sequestrant | • Colesevelam | 625 mg tabs 3.75 g suspension | $711 ($674, $712) $674 ($673, $675) | $64 $130 | 3.75 g 3.75 g |\\n| Dopamine-2 agonist | • Bromocriptine | 0.8 mg | $1,200 | $965 | 4.8 mg |\\n| Amylin mimetic | • Pramlintide | 120 µg pen | $2,866 | NA | 120 µg/injection [§](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn8) |\\n\\n### Cardiovascular Outcomes Trials\\n\\nThere are now multiple large randomized controlled trials reporting statistically significant reductions in cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes treated with an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 RA; see Section 10, “ [Cardiovascular Disease and Risk Management](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S010),” for details. Participants enrolled in many of the cardiovascular outcomes trials had A1C ≥6.5% (≥48 mmol/mol), with more than 70% taking metformin at baseline, with analyses indicating benefit with or without metformin ( [84](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B84)). Thus, a practical extension of these results to clinical practice is to use these medications preferentially in people with type 2 diabetes and established ASCVD or indicators of high ASCVD risk. For these individuals, incorporating one of the SGLT2 inhibitors and/or GLP-1 RAs that have been demonstrated to have cardiovascular disease benefit is recommended (see **[Fig. 9.3](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.3)**, **[Table 9.2](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T9.2)**, and Section 10, “ [Cardiovascular Disease and Risk Management](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S010)”). Emerging data suggest that use of both classes of drugs will provide additional cardiovascular and kidney outcomes benefit; thus, combination therapy with an SGLT2 inhibitor and a GLP-1 RA may be considered to provide the complementary outcomes benefits associated with these classes of medication ( [121](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B121)). In cardiovascular outcomes trials, empagliflozin, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, liraglutide, semaglutide, and dulaglutide all had beneficial effects on indices of CKD, while dedicated renal outcomes studies have demonstrated benefit of specific SGLT2 inhibitors. See Section 11, “ [Chronic Kidney Disease and Risk Management](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S011),” for discussion of how CKD may impact treatment choices. Additional large randomized trials of other agents in these classes are ongoing.\\n\\nIndividuals at low risk for ASCVD may benefit from GLP-1 RA therapy to reduce their risk of future ASCVD events, although the evidence is currently limited. The Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Type 2 Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness Study (GRADE), which was designed to examine the comparative effectiveness of insulin glargine U-100, glimepiride, liraglutide, and sitagliptin in individuals with short duration of diabetes with respect to achieving and maintaining glycemic control, found that individuals treated with liraglutide had a slightly lower risk of cardiovascular disease compared with individuals receiving the other three treatments (hazard ratio 0.7 \\\\[95% CI 0.6–0.9\\\\]), although no significant differences were found for major adverse cardiovascular events, hospitalization for HF, or cardiovascular death ( [122](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B122)).\\n\\n### Insulin Therapy\\n\\nMany adults with type 2 diabetes eventually require and benefit from insulin therapy ( **[Fig. 9.4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.4)**). See the section insulin administration technique, above, for guidance on how to administer insulin safely and effectively. The progressive nature of type 2 diabetes should be regularly and objectively explained to individuals with diabetes, and clinicians should avoid using insulin as a threat or describing it as a sign of personal failure or punishment. Rather, the utility and importance of insulin to maintain glycemic control once progression of the disease overcomes the effect of other agents should be emphasized. Educating and involving people with diabetes in insulin management is beneficial. For example, instruction of individuals with type 2 diabetes initiating insulin in self-titration of insulin doses based on glucose monitoring improves glycemic management ( [123](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B123)). Comprehensive education regarding blood glucose monitoring, nutrition, and the avoidance and appropriate treatment of hypoglycemia are critically important in any individual using insulin.\\n\\n#### Basal Insulin\\n\\nBasal insulin alone is the most convenient initial insulin treatment and can be added to metformin and other noninsulin injectables for individuals with type 2 diabetes. Starting doses can be estimated based on body weight (0.1–0.2 units/kg/day) and the degree of hyperglycemia, with individualized titration over days to weeks as needed. The principal action of basal insulin is to restrain hepatic glucose production and limit hyperglycemia overnight and between meals ( [124](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B124), [125](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B125)). Attainment of fasting glucose goals can be achieved with human NPH insulin or a long-acting insulin analog. In clinical trials, long-acting basal analogs (U-100 glargine or detemir) have been demonstrated to reduce the risk of level 2 hypoglycemia and nocturnal hypoglycemia compared with NPH insulin ( [126](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B126)). Longer-acting basal analogs (U-300 glargine or degludec) convey a lower nocturnal hypoglycemia risk compared with U-100 glargine ( [127](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B127), [128](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B128)). Clinicians should be aware of the potential for overbasalization with insulin therapy. Clinical signals that may prompt evaluation of overbasalization include basal dose greater than ∼0.5 units/kg, high bedtime-to-morning or preprandial-to-postprandial glucose differential (e.g., bedtime-to-morning glucose differential ≥50 mg/dL \\\\[≥2.8 mmol/L\\\\]), hypoglycemia (aware or unaware), and high variability. Indication of overbasalization should prompt reevaluation to further individualize therapy ( [129](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B129)).\\n\\nThe cost of insulin has been rising steadily over the past two decades, at a pace severalfold that of other medical expenditures. This expense contributes significant burden to people with diabetes, as insulin has become a growing “out-of-pocket” cost for people with diabetes, and direct costs contribute to decrease in medication-taking behavior ( [130](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B130)). As of January 2023, the cost of individual insulins was capped for enrollees in Medicare Part D plans ( [131](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B131)), and at least 20 states and the District of Columbia have also capped insulin costs for enrollees in state-sponsored plans and, in select states, for those without insurance. In 2023, the three major U.S. insulin manufacturers also announced plans to reduce insulin prices; some plans go into effect in January 2024, and another has already occurred. The summary of the cost of insulin products in **[Table 9.4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T9.4)** provides a comparison but is not reflective of the Medicare or state-level caps or the recent manufacturer price reductions. However, the information in **[Table 9.4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T9.4)** reflects how the approval of unbranded versions (insulin aspart, lispro, degludec, glargine U-100, and some premixed products), follow-on products (insulin lispro and glargine), and interchangeable biosimilars (insulin glargine) have led to lower costs compared with other products. For some individuals with type 2 diabetes (e.g., individuals with relaxed A1C goals, low rates of hypoglycemia, and prominent insulin resistance as well as those with cost concerns), human insulin (NPH and regular) may be the appropriate choice of therapy, and clinicians should be familiar with its use ( [132](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B132)). Human regular insulin, NPH, and 70/30 NPH/regular products can be purchased for considerably less than the AWP and NADAC prices listed in **[Table 9.4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#T9.4)** at select pharmacies. It is important to note that although these caps, price reductions, use of unbranded or biosimilar versions of analogs, or use of human insulins may impact the cost of insulin products, there are no caps on the costs of the other tools individuals with diabetes need for monitoring or treatment (including glucose monitoring supplies \\\\[strips or sensors\\\\], administration tools \\\\[pen needles, syringes, and insulin pumps\\\\], ketone testing supplies, and glucagon). Therefore, routine assessment of financial obstacles that may impact diabetes management is an important component of effective care of people with diabetes. Collaboration between members of the health care team and with social service professionals to identify and implement cost reduction strategies to support and improve access to evidence-based care is important ( [120](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B120), [130](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B130)).\\n\\n##### Table 9.4.\\n\\nMedian cost of insulin products in the U.S. calculated as AWP and NADAC per 1,000 units of specified dosage form/product\\n\\n| Insulins | Compounds | Dosage form/product | Median AWP (min, max) [\\\\*](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn10) | Median NADAC [\\\\*](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn10) |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| Rapid-acting | • Aspart | U-100 vial | $174 [†](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn11) | $139 [†](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn11) |\\n| | | U-100 cartridge | $215 [†](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn11) | $172 [†](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn11) |\\n| | | U-100 prefilled pen | $224 [†](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn11) | $179 [†](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn11) |\\n| | • Aspart (“faster acting product”) | U-100 vial | $347 | $277 |\\n| | | U-100 cartridge | $430 | $344 |\\n| | | U-100 prefilled pen | $447 | $357 |\\n| | • Glulisine | U-100 vial | $341 | $273 |\\n| | | U-100 prefilled pen | $439 | $351 |\\n| | • Inhaled insulin | Inhalation cartridges | $1,503 | NA |\\n| | • Lispro | U-100 vial | $30 [†](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn11) | $24 [†](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn11) |\\n| | | U-100 cartridge | $408 | $326 |\\n| | | U-100 prefilled pen | $127 [†](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn11) | $102 [†](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn11) |\\n| | | U-200 prefilled pen | $424 | $339 |\\n| | • Lispro-aabc | U-100 vial | $330 | $261 |\\n| | | U-100 prefilled pen | $424 | $339 |\\n| | | U-200 prefilled pen | $424 | $338 |\\n| | • Lispro follow-on product | U-100 vial | $118 | $94 |\\n| | | U-100 prefilled pen | $151 | $121 |\\n| Short-acting | • Human regular | U-100 vial | $172 ($165, $178) [‡](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn12) | $137 ($132, $142) [‡](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn12) |\\n| | | U-100 prefilled pen | $208 | $166 |\\n| Intermediate-acting | • Human NPH | U-100 vial | $172 ($165, $178) [‡](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn12) | $137 ($132, $143) [‡](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#tblfn12) |\\n| | | U-100 prefilled pen | $208 ($208, $377) | $234 ($166, $303) |\\n| Concentrated human regular insulin | • U-500 human regular insulin | U-500 vial | $178 | $142 |\\n| U-500 prefilled pen | $230 | $184 |\\n| Long-acting | • Detemir | U-100 vial;

If an individual is not already being treated with a GLP-1 RA or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, a GLP-1 RA (either as an individual product or in a fixed-ratio combination with a basal insulin product) or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA should be considered prior to prandial insulin to further address prandial control and to minimize the risks of hypoglycemia and weight gain associated with insulin therapy ( [84](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B84), [114](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B114)). For individuals who advance to prandial insulin, a prandial insulin dose of 4 units or 10% of the amount of basal insulin at the largest meal or the meal with the greatest postprandial excursion is a safe estimate for initiating therapy. The prandial insulin plan can then be intensified based on individual needs ( **[Fig. 9.4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.4)**). Individuals with type 2 diabetes are generally more insulin resistant than those with type 1 diabetes, require higher daily doses (∼1 unit/kg), and have lower rates of hypoglycemia ( [133](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B133)). Titration can be based on home self-monitored blood glucose or CGM. When significant additions to the prandial insulin dose are made, particularly with the evening meal, consideration should be given to decreasing basal insulin. Meta-analyses of trials comparing rapid-acting insulin analogs with human regular insulin in type 2 diabetes have not reported important differences in A1C or hypoglycemia ( [134](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B134), [135](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B135)).\\n\\n#### Concentrated Insulins\\n\\nSeveral concentrated insulin preparations are currently available. U-500 regular insulin is, by definition, five times more concentrated than U-100 regular insulin. U-500 regular insulin has distinct pharmacokinetics with similar onset but a delayed, blunted, and prolonged peak effect and longer duration of action compared with U-100 regular insulin; thus, it has characteristics more like a premixed intermediate-acting (NPH) and regular insulin product and can be used as two or three daily injections ( [136](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B136), [137](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B137)). U-300 glargine and U-200 degludec are three and two times as concentrated as their U-100 formulations, respectively, and allow higher doses of basal insulin administration per volume used. U-300 glargine has a longer duration of action than U-100 glargine but modestly lower efficacy per unit administered ( [138](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B138)– [140](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B140)). The U-200 formulations of insulin degludec, insulin lispro, and insulin lispro-aabc have similar pharmacokinetics to their U-100 counterparts ( [141](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B141)– [143](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B143)). These concentrated preparations may be more convenient (fewer injections to achieve target dose) and comfortable (less volume to inject target dose and/or less injection effort) for individuals and may improve treatment plan engagement in those with insulin resistance who require large doses of insulin. While U-500 regular insulin is available in both prefilled pens and vials, other concentrated insulins are available only in prefilled pens to minimize the risk of dosing errors. If U-500 regular insulin vials are prescribed, the prescription should be accompanied by a prescription for U-500 syringes to minimize the risk of dosing errors.\\n\\n#### Alternative Insulin Routes\\n\\nInsulin is primarily administered via subcutaneous injection or infusion. Administration devices provide some additional variation in the subcutaneous delivery beyond vial versus insulin pen. Those devices include continuous insulin pumps (programmable basal and bolus settings and fixed basal and bolus settings) and bolus-only insulin patch pump. In addition, prandial or correction insulin doses may be administered using inhaled human insulin. Inhaled insulin is available as monomers of regular human insulin; studies in individuals with type 1 diabetes suggest that inhaled insulin has pharmacokinetics similar to RAA ( [7](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B7)). Studies comparing inhaled insulin with injectable insulin have demonstrated its faster onset and shorter duration compared with the RAA insulin lispro, as well as clinically meaningful A1C reductions and weight reductions compared with the RAA insulin aspart over 24 weeks ( [144](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B144)– [146](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B146)). Use of inhaled insulin may result in a decline in lung function (reduced forced expiratory volume in 1 second \\\\[FEV1\\\\]). Inhaled insulin is contraindicated in individuals with chronic lung disease, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and is not recommended in individuals who smoke or who recently stopped smoking. All individuals require spirometry (FEV1) testing to identify potential lung disease prior to and after starting inhaled insulin therapy.\\n\\n### Combination Injectable Therapy\\n\\nIf basal insulin has been titrated to an acceptable fasting blood glucose level (or if the dose is >0.5 units/kg/day with indications of need for other therapy) and A1C remains above goal, consider advancing to combination injectable therapy ( **[Fig. 9.4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.4)**). This approach can use a GLP-1 RA or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA added to basal insulin or multiple doses of insulin ( [114](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B114), [147](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B147)). The combination of basal insulin and GLP-1 RA (administered via separate injections of individual products or single injection of a fixed-ratio product) has potent glucose-lowering actions and less weight gain and hypoglycemia compared with intensified insulin plans ( [148](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B148)). Two different once-daily, fixed dual combination products containing basal insulin plus a GLP-1 RA are available: insulin glargine plus lixisenatide (iGlarLixi) and insulin degludec plus liraglutide (IDegLira). In select individuals with type 2 diabetes, complex insulin plans can also be simplified with fixed-ratio GLP-1 RA-insulin product ( [149](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B149)).\\n\\nIntensification of insulin treatment can be done by adding doses of prandial insulin to basal insulin. Starting with a single prandial dose with the largest meal of the day is simple and effective, and it can be advanced to a plan with multiple prandial doses if necessary ( [150](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#B150)). Alternatively, for an individual on basal insulin in whom additional prandial coverage is desired but administering insulin prior to one or more meal(s) is not feasible, the medication plan can be converted to two doses of a premixed insulin. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages. For example, basal-prandial plans offer greater flexibility for individuals who eat on irregular schedules. On the other hand, two doses of premixed insulin is a simple, convenient means of spreading insulin across the day. Moreover, human insulins, separately, self-mixed, or as premixed NPH/regular (70/30) formulations, are less costly alternatives to insulin analogs. **[Figure 9.4](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#F9.4)** outlines these options as well as recommendations for further intensification, if needed, to achieve glycemic goals. When initiating intensification of insulin therapy, metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors, and GLP-1 RA (or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA) should be maintained, while sulfonylureas and DPP-4 inhibitors are typically weaned or discontinued. In individuals with suboptimal blood glucose management, especially those requiring large insulin doses, adjunctive use of a thiazolidinedione or an SGLT2 inhibitor may help to improve control and reduce the amount of insulin needed, although potential side effects should be considered. Once a basal-bolus insulin plan is initiated, dose titration is important, with adjustments made in both mealtime and basal insulins based on the blood glucose levels and an understanding of the pharmacodynamic profile of each formulation (also known as pattern control or pattern management). In some people with type 2 diabetes with significant clinical complexity, multimorbidity, and/or treatment burden, it may become necessary to simplify or deintensify complex insulin plans to decrease risk of hypoglycemia and improve quality of life (see Section 13, “ [Older Adults](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-S013)”).\\n\\n## Footnotes\\n\\nSuggested citation: American Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee. 9.

Diabetes can be diagnosed by demonstrating increased concentrations of glucose in venous plasma or increased A1C in the blood. Diabetes is classified conventionally into several clinical categories (e.g., type 1 or type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes mellitus, and other specific types derived from other causes, such as genetic causes, exocrine pancreatic disorders, and medications) (2). \\n Diagnostic Tests for Diabetes \\n Recommendations \\n \\n \\n 2.1a Diagnose diabetes based on A1C or plasma glucose criteria, either the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) value, 2-h plasma glucose (2-h PG) value during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or random glucose value accompanied by classic hyperglycemic symptoms/crises criteria ( Table 2.1 ). A 2.1b In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia (e.g., hyperglycemic crises), diagnosis requires confirmatory testing ( Table 2.1 ). A \\n \\n Diabetes may be diagnosed based on A1C criteria or plasma glucose criteria, either the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) value, 2-h glucose (2-h PG) value during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or random glucose value accompanied by classic hyperglycemic symptoms (e.g., polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss) or hyperglycemic crises ( Table 2.1 ). \\n Criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes in nonpregnant individuals A1C ≥6.5% (≥48 mmol/mol). The test should be performed in a laboratory using a method that is NGSP certified and standardized to the DCCT assay.*  OR  FPG ≥126 mg/dL (≥7.0 mmol/L). Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 h.*  OR  2-h PG ≥200 mg/dL (≥11.1 mmol/L) during OGTT. The test should be performed as described by the WHO, using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75 g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water.*  OR  In an individual with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis, a random plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL (≥11.1 mmol/L). Random is any time of the day without regard to time since previous meal.  A1C ≥6.5% (≥48 mmol/mol). The test should be performed in a laboratory using a method that is NGSP certified and standardized to the DCCT assay.*  OR  FPG ≥126 mg/dL (≥7.0 mmol/L). Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 h.*  OR  2-h PG ≥200 mg/dL (≥11.1 mmol/L) during OGTT. The test should be performed as described by the WHO, using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75 g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water.*  OR  In an individual with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis, a random plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL (≥11.1 mmol/L). Random is any time of the day without regard to time since previous meal.  DCCT, Diabetes Control and Complications Trial; FPG, fasting plasma glucose; OGTT, oral glucose tolerance test; NGSP, National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program; WHO, World Health Organization; 2-h PG, 2-h plasma glucose. In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, diagnosis requires two abnormal test results obtained at the same time (e.g., A1C and FPG) or at two different time points. \\n FPG, 2-h PG during 75-g OGTT, and A1C are appropriate for diagnostic screening. It should be noted that detection rates of different screening tests vary in both populations and individuals. FPG, 2-h PG, and A1C reflect different aspects of glucose metabolism, and diagnostic cut points for the different tests will identify different groups of people (3). Compared with FPG and A1C cut points, the 2-h PG value diagnoses more people with prediabetes and diabetes (4). Moreover, the efficacy of interventions for primary prevention of type 2 diabetes has mainly been demonstrated among individuals who have impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) with or without elevated fasting glucose, not for individuals with isolated impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or for those with prediabetes defined by A1C criteria (5–8). \\n The same tests may be used to screen for and diagnose diabetes and to detect individuals with prediabetes (9) ( Table 2.1  and Table 2.2 ). Diabetes may be identified anywhere along the spectrum of clinical scenarios—in seemingly low-risk individuals who happen to have glucose testing, in individuals screened based on diabetes risk assessment, and in symptomatic individuals. There is presently insufficient evidence to support the use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for screening or diagnosis of prediabetes or diabetes. For additional details on the evidence used to establish the criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes, prediabetes, and abnormal glucose tolerance (IFG and IGT), see the American Diabetes Association (ADA) position statement “Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus” (2) and other reports (3,10,11). \\n Criteria defining prediabetes in nonpregnant individuals A1C 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol)  OR  FPG 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) to 125 mg/dL (6.9 mmol/L) (IFG)  OR  2-h PG during 75-g OGTT 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) to 199 mg/dL (11.0 mmol/L) (IGT)  A1C 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol)  OR  FPG 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) to 125 mg/dL (6.9 mmol/L) (IFG)  OR  2-h PG during 75-g OGTT 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) to 199 mg/dL (11.0 mmol/L) (IGT)  For all three tests, risk is continuous, extending below the lower limit of the range and becoming disproportionately greater at the higher end of the range. FPG, fasting plasma glucose; IFG, impaired fasting glucose; IGT, impaired glucose tolerance; OGTT, oral glucose tolerance test; 2-h PG, 2-h plasma glucose. \\n \\n Use of Fasting Plasma Glucose or 2-Hour Plasma Glucose for Screening and Diagnosis of Diabetes \\n \\n In the less common clinical scenario where a person has classic hyperglycemic symptoms (e.g., polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss), measurement of random plasma glucose is sufficient to diagnose diabetes (symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis plus random plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL [≥11.1 mmol/L]). In these cases, knowing the plasma glucose level is critical because, in addition to confirming that symptoms are due to diabetes, it will inform management decisions. Health care professionals may also want to know the A1C to determine the chronicity of hyperglycemia. \\n In an individual without symptoms, FPG or 2-h PG can be used for screening and diagnosis of diabetes. In nonpregnant individuals, FPG (or A1C) is typically preferred for routine screening due to the ease of administration; however, the 2-h PG (OGTT) testing protocol may identify individuals with diabetes who may otherwise be missed (e.g., those with cystic fibrosis–related diabetes or posttransplantation diabetes mellitus). In the absence of classic hyperglycemic symptoms, repeat testing is required to confirm the diagnosis regardless of the test used (see , below). \\n An advantage of glucose testing is that these assays are inexpensive and widely available. Disadvantages include the high diurnal variation in glucose and fasting requirement. Individuals may have difficulty fasting for the full 8-h period or may misreport their fasting status. Recent physical activity, illness, or acute stress can also affect glucose concentrations. Glycolysis is also an important and underrecognized concern with glucose testing. Glucose concentrations will be falsely low if samples are not processed promptly or stored properly prior to analysis (1). \\n People should consume a mixed diet with at least 150 g of carbohydrates on the 3 days prior to OGTT (12–14). Fasting and carbohydrate restriction can falsely elevate glucose level with an oral glucose challenge. \\n \\n Use of A1C for Screening and Diagnosis of Diabetes \\n Recommendations \\n \\n \\n 2.2a The A1C test should be performed using a method that is certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) as traceable to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) reference assay. B 2.2b Point-of-care A1C testing for diabetes screening and diagnosis should be restricted to U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved devices at Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)–certified laboratories that perform testing of moderate complexity or higher by trained personnel. B 2.3 Marked discordance between A1C and repeat blood glucose values should raise the possibility of a problem or interference with either test. B 2.4 In conditions associated with an altered relationship between A1C and glycemia, such as some hemoglobin variants, pregnancy (second and third trimesters and the postpartum period), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, HIV, hemodialysis, recent blood loss or transfusion, or erythropoietin therapy, plasma glucose criteria should be used to diagnose diabetes. B \\n \\n The A1C test should be performed using a method that is certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) ( ngsp.org) and standardized or traceable to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) reference assay. Point-of-care A1C assays may be NGSP certified and cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in monitoring glycemic control in people with diabetes in both Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)–regulated and CLIA-waived settings. FDA-approved point-of-care A1C testing can be used in laboratories or sites that are CLIA certified, are inspected, and meet the CLIA quality standards. These standards include specified personnel requirements (including documented annual competency assessments) and participation three times per year in an approved proficiency testing program (15–18). \\n A1C has several advantages compared with FPG and OGTT, including greater convenience (fasting not required), greater preanalytical stability, and fewer day-to-day perturbations during stress, changes in nutrition, or illness. However, it should be noted that there is lower sensitivity of A1C at the designated cut point compared with that of glucose tests as well as greater cost and limited access in some parts of the world. \\n A1C reflects glucose bound to hemoglobin over the life span of the erythrocyte (∼120 days) and is thus a “weighted” average that is more heavily affected by recent blood glucose exposure. This means that clinically meaningful changes in A1C can be seen in &lt;120 days. A1C is an indirect measure of glucose exposure, and factors that affect hemoglobin concentrations or erythrocyte turnover can affect A1C (e.g., thalassemia or folate deficiency). A1C may not be a suitable diagnostic test in people with anemia, people treated with erythropoietin, or people undergoing hemodialysis or HIV treatment (19,20). Some hemoglobin variants can interfere with A1C test results, but this depends on the specific assay. For individuals with a hemoglobin variant but normal red blood cell turnover, such as those with the sickle cell trait, an A1C assay without interference from hemoglobin variants should be used. An updated list of A1C assays with interferences is available at ngsp.org/interf.asp. Another genetic variant, X-linked glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase G202A, carried by 11% of African American individuals in the U.S., is associated with a decrease in A1C of about 0.8% in homozygous men and 0.7% in homozygous women compared with levels in individuals without the variant (21). \\n There is controversy regarding racial differences in A1C. Studies have found that African American individuals have slightly higher A1C levels than non-Hispanic White or Hispanic people (22–25). The glucose-independent racial difference in A1C is small (∼0.3 percentage points) and may reflect genetic differences in hemoglobin or red cell turnover that vary by ancestry. There is an emerging understanding of the genetic determinants of A1C (21), but the field lacks adequate genetic data in diverse populations (26,27). While some genetic variants might be more common in certain race or ancestry groups, it is important that we do not use race or ancestry as proxies for poorly understood genetic differences. Reassuringly, studies have shown that the association of A1C with risk for complications appears to be similar in African American and non-Hispanic White populations (28). \\n \\n Confirming the Diagnosis \\n \\n Unless there is a clear clinical diagnosis (e.g., individual with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis and random plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL [≥11.1 mmol/L]), diagnosis requires two abnormal screening test results, measured either at the same time (29) or at two different time points. If using samples at two different time points, it is recommended that the second test, which may be either a repeat of the initial test or a different test, be performed promptly. For example, if the A1C is 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) and a repeat result is 6.8% (51 mmol/mol), the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed. Two different tests (such as A1C and FPG) both having results above the diagnostic threshold when collected at the same time or at two different time points would also confirm the diagnosis. On the other hand, if an individual has discordant results from two different tests, then the test result that is above the diagnostic cut point should be repeated, with careful consideration of factors that may affect measured A1C or glucose levels. The diagnosis is made based on the confirmatory screening test. For example, if an individual meets the diabetes criterion of A1C (two results ≥6.5% [≥48 mmol/mol]) but not FPG (&lt;126 mg/dL [&lt;7.0 mmol/L]), that person should nevertheless be considered to have diabetes. \\n If individuals have test results near the margins of the diagnostic threshold, the health care professional should educate the individual about the onset of possible hyperglycemic symptoms and repeat the test in 3–6 months. \\n Consistent and substantial discordance between glucose and A1C test results should prompt additional follow-up to determine the underlying reason for the discrepancy and whether it has clinical implications for the individual. In addition, consider other biomarkers, such as fructosamine and glycated albumin, which are alternative measures of chronic hyperglycemia that are approved for clinical use for monitoring glycemic control in people with diabetes. \\n \\n Classification \\n Recommendation \\n \\n \\n 2.5 Classify people with hyperglycemia into appropriate diagnostic categories to aid in personalized management. E \\n \\n \\n Diabetes is classified conventionally into several clinical categories, although these are being reconsidered based on genetic, metabolomic, and other characteristics and pathophysiology (2): Type 1 diabetes (due to autoimmune β-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency, including latent autoimmune diabetes in adults) Type 2 diabetes (due to a non-autoimmune progressive loss of adequate β-cell insulin secretion, frequently on the background of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome) Specific types of diabetes due to other causes, e.g., monogenic diabetes syndromes (such as neonatal diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of the young), diseases of the exocrine pancreas (such as cystic fibrosis and pancreatitis), and drug- or chemical-induced diabetes (such as with glucocorticoid use, in the treatment of people with HIV, or after organ transplantation) Gestational diabetes mellitus (diabetes diagnosed in the second or third trimester of pregnancy that was not clearly overt diabetes prior to gestation or other types of diabetes occurring throughout pregnancy, such as type 1 diabetes). \\n \\n This section reviews most common forms of diabetes but is not comprehensive. For additional information, see the ADA position statement “Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus” (2). \\n Type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are heterogeneous diseases in which clinical presentation and disease progression may vary considerably. Classification is important for determining personalized therapy, but some individuals cannot be clearly classified as having type 1 or type 2 diabetes at the time of diagnosis. The traditional paradigms of type 2 diabetes occurring only in adults and type 1 diabetes only in children are not accurate, as both diseases occur in all age-groups. Children with type 1 diabetes often present with the hallmark symptoms of polyuria/polydipsia, and approximately half present with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) (30–32). The onset of type 1 diabetes may be more variable in adults; they may not present with the classic symptoms seen in children and may experience temporary remission from the need for anticipated full-dose insulin replacement (33–35). The features most useful in discrimination of type 1 diabetes include younger age at diagnosis (&lt;35 years) with lower BMI (&lt;25 kg/m 2), unintentional weight loss, ketoacidosis, and plasma glucose &gt;360 mg/dL (&gt;20 mmol/L) at presentation (36) ( Fig. 2.1 ). Other features classically associated with type 1 diabetes, such as ketosis without acidosis, osmotic symptoms, family history, or a history of autoimmune diseases, are weak discriminators. Occasionally, people with type 2 diabetes may present with DKA (37,38), particularly members of certain racial and ethnic groups (e.g., African American adults, who may present with ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes) (39). \\n \\n Figure 2.1 Flowchart for investigation of suspected type 1 diabetes in newly diagnosed adults, based on data from White European populations. 1 No single clinical feature confirms type 1 diabetes in isolation. 2 Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) should be the primary antibody measured and, if negative, should be followed by islet tyrosine phosphatase 2 (IA-2) and/or zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8) where these tests are available. In individuals who have not been treated with insulin, antibodies against insulin may also be useful. In those diagnosed at &lt;35 years of age who have no clinical features of type 2 diabetes or monogenic diabetes, a negative result does not change the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, since 5–10% of people with type 1 diabetes do not have antibodies. 3 Monogenic diabetes is suggested by the presence of one or more of the following features: A1C &lt;58 mmol/mol (&lt;7.5%) at diagnosis, one parent with diabetes, features of a specific monogenic cause (e.g., renal cysts, partial lipodystrophy, maternally inherited deafness, and severe insulin resistance in the absence of obesity), and monogenic diabetes prediction model probability &gt;5% ( diabetesgenes.org/exeter-diabetes-app/ModyCalculator). 4 A C-peptide test is only indicated in people receiving insulin treatment. A random sample (with concurrent glucose) within 5 h of eating can replace a formal C-peptide stimulation test in the context of classification. If the result is ≥600 pmol/L (≥1.8 ng/mL), the circumstances of testing do not matter. If the result is &lt;600 pmol/L (&lt;1.8 ng/mL) and the concurrent glucose is &lt;4 mmol/L (&lt;70 mg/dL) or the person may have been fasting, consider repeating the test. Results showing very low levels (e.g., &lt;80 pmol/L [&lt;0.24 ng/mL]) do not need to be repeated. Where a person is insulin treated, C-peptide must be measured prior to insulin discontinuation to exclude severe insulin deficiency. Do not test C-peptide within 2 weeks of a hyperglycemic emergency. 5 Features of type 2 diabetes include increased BMI (≥25 kg/m 2), absence of weight loss, absence of ketoacidosis, and less marked hyperglycemia. Less discriminatory features include non-White ethnicity, family history, longer duration and milder severity of symptoms prior to presentation, features of the metabolic syndrome, and absence of a family history of autoimmunity. 6 If genetic testing does not confirm monogenic diabetes, the classification is unclear and a clinical decision should be made about treatment. 7 Type 2 diabetes should be strongly considered in older individuals. In some cases, investigation for pancreatic or other types of diabetes may be appropriate. 8 A person with possible type 1 diabetes who is not treated with insulin will require careful monitoring and education so that insulin can be rapidly initiated in the event of glycemic deterioration. 9 C-peptide values 200–600 pmol/L (0.6–1.8 ng/mL) are usually consistent with type 1 diabetes or maturity-onset diabetes of the young but may occur in insulin-treated type 2 diabetes, particularly in people with normal or low BMI or after long duration. Reprinted and adapted from Holt et al. (36).

Reprinted and adapted from Holt et al. (36). \\n \\n It is important for health care professionals to realize that classification of diabetes type is not always straightforward at presentation and that misdiagnosis is common and can occur in ∼40% of adults with new type 1 diabetes (e.g., adults with type 1 diabetes misdiagnosed as having type 2 diabetes and individuals with maturity-onset diabetes of the young [MODY] misdiagnosed as having type 1 diabetes) (36). Although difficulties in distinguishing diabetes type may occur in all age-groups at onset, the diagnosis becomes more obvious over time in people with β-cell deficiency as the degree of β-cell deficiency becomes clear ( Fig. 2.1 ). One useful clinical tool for distinguishing diabetes type is the AABBCC approach: Age (e.g., for individuals &lt;35 years old, consider type 1 diabetes); Autoimmunity (e.g., personal or family history of autoimmune disease or polyglandular autoimmune syndromes); Body habitus (e.g., BMI &lt;25 kg/m 2); Background (e.g., family history of type 1 diabetes); Control (e.g., level of glucose control on noninsulin therapies); and Comorbidities (e.g., treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors for cancer can cause acute autoimmune type 1 diabetes) (36). \\n In both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, genetic and environmental factors can result in the progressive loss of β-cell mass and/or function that manifests clinically as hyperglycemia. Once hyperglycemia occurs, people with all forms of diabetes are at risk for developing the same chronic complications, although rates of progression may differ. The identification of individualized therapies for diabetes in the future will be informed by better characterization of the many paths to β-cell demise or dysfunction (40). Across the globe, many groups are working on combining clinical, pathophysiological, and genetic characteristics to more precisely define the subsets of diabetes that are currently clustered into the type 1 diabetes versus type 2 diabetes nomenclature with the goal of optimizing personalized treatment approaches (41). \\n Characterization of the underlying pathophysiology is more precisely developed in type 1 diabetes than in type 2 diabetes. It is clear from prospective studies that the persistent presence of two or more islet autoantibodies is a near-certain predictor of clinical diabetes (42). In at-risk cohorts followed from birth or a very young age, seroconversion rarely occurs before 6 months of age and there is a peak in seroconversion between 9 and 24 months of age (43–45). The rate of progression is dependent on the age at first detection of autoantibody, number of autoantibodies, autoantibody specificity, and autoantibody titer. Glucose and A1C levels may rise well before the clinical onset of diabetes (e.g., changes in FPG and 2-h PG can occur about 6 months before diagnosis) (46), making diagnosis feasible well before the onset of DKA. Three distinct stages of type 1 diabetes have been defined ( Table 2.3 ) and serve as a framework for research and regulatory decision-making (40,47). \\n Staging of type 1 diabetes Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 Characteristics  • Autoimmunity  • Autoimmunity  • Autoimmunity  • Normoglycemia  • Dysglycemia  • Overt hyperglycemia  • Presymptomatic  • Presymptomatic  • Symptomatic  Diagnostic criteria  • Multiple islet autoantibodies • No IGT or IFG  • Islet autoantibodies (usually multiple) • Dysglycemia: IFG and/or IGT • FPG 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L) • 2-h PG 140–199 mg/dL (7.8–11.0 mmol/L) • A1C 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol) or ≥10% increase in A1C  • Autoantibodies may become absent • Diabetes by standard criteria  Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 Characteristics  • Autoimmunity  • Autoimmunity  • Autoimmunity  • Normoglycemia  • Dysglycemia  • Overt hyperglycemia  • Presymptomatic  • Presymptomatic  • Symptomatic  Diagnostic criteria  • Multiple islet autoantibodies • No IGT or IFG  • Islet autoantibodies (usually multiple) • Dysglycemia: IFG and/or IGT • FPG 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L) • 2-h PG 140–199 mg/dL (7.8–11.0 mmol/L) • A1C 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol) or ≥10% increase in A1C  • Autoantibodies may become absent • Diabetes by standard criteria  Adapted from Skyler et al. (40). FPG, fasting plasma glucose; IFG, impaired fasting glucose; IGT, impaired glucose tolerance; 2-h PG, 2-h plasma glucose. Alternative additional stage 2 diagnostic criteria of 30-, 60-, or 90-min plasma glucose on oral glucose tolerance test ≥200 mg/dL (≥11.1 mmol/L) and confirmatory testing in those aged ≥18 years have been used in clinical trials (79). \\n There is debate as to whether slowly progressive autoimmune diabetes with an adult onset should be termed latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) or type 1 diabetes. The clinical priority with detection of LADA is awareness that slow autoimmune β-cell destruction can occur in adults, leading to a long duration of marginal insulin secretory capacity. For this classification, all forms of diabetes mediated by autoimmune β-cell destruction independent of age of onset are included under the rubric of type 1 diabetes. Use of the term LADA is common and acceptable in clinical practice and has the practical impact of heightening awareness of a population of adults likely to have progressive autoimmune β-cell destruction (48), thus accelerating insulin initiation prior to deterioration of glucose management or development of DKA (34,49). At the same time, there is evidence that application of only a single imperfect autoantibody test for determining LADA classification may lead to misclassification of some individuals with type 2 diabetes. Diagnostic accuracy may be improved by utilizing higher-specificity tests, confirmatory testing for other autoantibodies, and restricting testing to those with clinical features suggestive of autoimmune diabetes (50). \\n The paths to β-cell demise and dysfunction are less well defined in type 2 diabetes, but deficient β-cell insulin secretion, frequently in the setting of insulin resistance, appears to be the common denominator. Type 2 diabetes is associated with insulin secretory defects related to genetic predisposition, epigenetic changes, inflammation, and metabolic stress. Future classification schemes for diabetes will likely focus on the pathophysiology of the underlying β-cell dysfunction (40,51–54). \\n \\n Type 1 Diabetes \\n Recommendations \\n \\n 2.6 Screening for presymptomatic type 1 diabetes may be done by detection of autoantibodies to insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), islet antigen 2 (IA-2), or zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8). B 2.7 Having multiple confirmed islet autoantibodies is a risk factor for clinical diabetes. Testing for dysglycemia may be used to further forecast near-term risk. When multiple islet autoantibodies are identified, referral to a specialized center for further evaluation and/or consideration of a clinical trial or approved therapy to potentially delay development of clinical diabetes should be considered. B 2.8 Standardized islet autoantibody tests are recommended for classification of diabetes in adults who have phenotypic risk factors that overlap with those for type 1 diabetes (e.g., younger age at diagnosis, unintentional weight loss, ketoacidosis, or short time to insulin treatment). E \\n \\n Immune-Mediated Diabetes \\n \\n Autoimmune type 1 diabetes accounts for 5–10% of diabetes and is caused by autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic β-cells. Autoimmune markers include islet cell autoantibodies and autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) (such as GAD65), insulin, the tyrosine phosphatases islet antigen 2 (IA-2) and IA-2β, and zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8). Numerous clinical studies are being conducted to test various methods of preventing or delaying type 1 diabetes in those with evidence of islet autoimmunity ( trialnet.org/our-research/prevention-studies) (42–44,49,55,56). The disease has strong HLA associations, with linkage to the DQB1 and DRB1 haplotypes, and genetic screening has been used in some research studies to identify high-risk populations. Specific alleles in these genes can be either predisposing (e.g., DRB1*0301-DQB1*0201 [DR3-DQ2] and DRB1*0401-DQB1*0302 [DR4-DQ8]) or protective (e.g., DRB1*1501 and DQA1*0102-DQB1*0602). Stage 1 of type 1 diabetes is defined by the presence of two or more of these autoantibodies and normoglycemia. At stage 1, the 5-year risk of developing symptomatic type 1 diabetes is ∼44% overall but varies considerably based on number, titer, and specificity of autoantibodies as well as age of seroconversion and genetic risk (47). Stage 2 includes individuals with multiple islet autoantibodies and dysglycemia. At stage 2 of the disease, there is ∼60% risk by 2 years and ∼75% risk within 5 years of developing symptomatic type 1 diabetes (57,58). \\n The rate of β-cell destruction is quite variable, being rapid in some individuals (particularly but not exclusively in infants and children) and slow in others (mainly but not exclusively adults) (46,59). Children and adolescents often present with DKA as the first manifestation of the disease, and rates in the U.S. have increased dramatically over the past 20 years (30–32). Others have modest fasting hyperglycemia that can rapidly change to severe hyperglycemia and/or DKA with infection or other stress. Adults may retain sufficient β-cell function to prevent DKA for many years; such individuals may have remission or decreased insulin needs for months or years, eventually become dependent on insulin for survival, and are at risk for DKA (33–35,60,61). At this later stage of the disease, there is little or no insulin secretion, as manifested by low or undetectable levels of plasma C-peptide. Immune-mediated diabetes is the most common form of diabetes in childhood and adolescence, but it can occur at any age. \\n Autoimmune destruction of β-cells has multiple genetic factors and is also related to environmental factors that are still poorly defined. Although individuals do not typically have obesity when they present with type 1 diabetes, obesity is increasingly common in the general population; as such, obesity should not preclude testing for type 1 diabetes. People with type 1 diabetes are also prone to other autoimmune disorders, such as Hashimoto thyroiditis, Graves disease, celiac disease, Addison disease, vitiligo, autoimmune hepatitis, myasthenia gravis, and pernicious anemia (see Section 4, “ Comprehensive Medical Evaluation and Assessment of Comorbidities ”). Type 1 diabetes can be associated with monogenic polyglandular autoimmune syndromes, including immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, and X-linked (IPEX) syndrome, which is an early-onset systemic autoimmune, genetic disorder caused by mutation of the forkhead box protein 3 ( FOXP3) gene, and another disorder caused by the autoimmune regulator ( AIRE) gene mutation (62,63). \\n Introduction of immunotherapy, specifically checkpoint inhibitors, for cancer treatment has led to unexpected adverse events, including immune system activation precipitating autoimmune disease. Fulminant onset of type 1 diabetes can occur, with DKA and low or undetectable levels of C-peptide as a marker of endogenous β-cell function (64–66). Fewer than half of these individuals have autoantibodies that are seen in type 1 diabetes, supporting alternate pathobiology. This immune-related adverse event occurs in just under 1% of checkpoint inhibitor–treated individuals but most commonly occurs with agents that block the programmed cell death protein 1/programmed cell death ligand 1 pathway alone or in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors (67). To date, the majority of immune checkpoint inhibitor–related cases of type 1 diabetes occur in people with high-risk HLA-DR4 (present in 76% of individuals), whereas other high-risk HLA alleles are not more common than those in the general population (67). To date, risk cannot be predicted by family history or autoantibodies, so all health care professionals administering these medications or caring for people who have a history of current or past exposure to these agents should be mindful of this adverse effect and educate and monitor individuals appropriately. \\n A number of viruses have been associated with type 1 diabetes, including enteroviruses such as Coxsackievirus B. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, cases of hyperglycemia, DKA, and new diabetes increased, suggesting that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a trigger for or can unmask type 1 diabetes (68). Possible mechanisms of β-cell damage include virus-triggered β-cell death, immune-mediated loss of pancreatic β-cells, and damage to β-cells because of infection of surrounding exocrine cells. The cytokine storm associated with COVID-19 infection is a highly inflammatory state that could also contribute. To better characterize and understand the pathogenesis of new-onset COVID-19–related diabetes, a global registry, CoviDIAB, has been established (69). \\n \\n Idiopathic Type 1 Diabetes \\n \\n Some forms of type 1 diabetes have no known etiologies. Individuals have permanent insulinopenia and are prone to DKA but have no evidence of β-cell autoimmunity. However, only a minority of people with type 1 diabetes fall into this category. \\n Individuals with autoantibody-negative diabetes of African or Asian ancestry may suffer from episodic DKA and exhibit varying degrees of insulin deficiency between episodes (70). This form of diabetes is usually considered a form of type 2 diabetes (ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes), is strongly inherited, and is not HLA associated. An absolute requirement for insulin replacement therapy in affected individuals may be intermittent. Future research is needed to determine the cause of β-cell dysfunction/destruction in this rare clinical scenario. \\n \\n Screening for Type 1 Diabetes Risk \\n \\n The incidence and prevalence of type 1 diabetes are increasing (71). People with type 1 diabetes often present with acute symptoms of diabetes and markedly elevated blood glucose levels, and 25–50% are diagnosed with life-threatening DKA (30–32). Multiple studies indicate that measuring islet autoantibodies in relatives of those with type 1 diabetes (47) or in children from the general population (72,73) can effectively identify those who will develop type 1 diabetes. A study reported the risk of progression to type 1 diabetes from the time of seroconversion to autoantibody positivity in three pediatric cohorts from Finland, Germany, and the U.S. Of the 585 children who developed more than two autoantibodies, nearly 70% developed type 1 diabetes within 10 years and 84% within 15 years (42). These findings are highly significant, because while the German group was recruited from offspring of parents with type 1 diabetes, the Finnish and American groups were recruited from the general population. Remarkably, the findings in all three groups were the same, suggesting that the same sequence of events led to clinical disease in both “sporadic” and familial cases of type 1 diabetes. Indeed, the risk of type 1 diabetes increases as the number of relevant autoantibodies detected increases (55,74,75). In The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study, type 1 diabetes developed in 21% of 363 subjects with at least one autoantibody at 3 years of age (76). Such testing, coupled with education about diabetes symptoms and close follow-up, has been shown to enable earlier diagnosis and to prevent DKA (77,78). \\n Several screening programs are available in Europe (e.g., Fr1da and gppad.org) and the U.S. (e.g., trialnet.org, askhealth.org, and cascadekids.org). Family history of autoimmune diabetes and personal or family history of allergic diseases or other autoimmune diseases increases the risk of autoimmune diabetes compared with the general population (78,79). Individuals who test autoantibody positive should be provided with or referred for counseling about the risk of developing diabetes, diabetes symptoms, and DKA prevention and should be given consideration for additional testing as applicable to help determine if they meet criteria for intervention aimed at delaying progression. \\n \\n Prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes \\n Recommendations \\n \\n \\n 2.9 Screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes with an assessment of risk factors or validated risk calculator should be done in asymptomatic adults. B 2.10a Testing for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic people should be considered in adults of any age with overweight or obesity who have one or more risk factors ( Table 2.4 ). B 2.10b For all other people, screening should begin at age 35 years. B 2.11 If tests are normal, repeat screening recommended at a minimum of 3-year intervals is reasonable, sooner with symptoms or change in risk (e.g., weight gain). C 2.12 To screen for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, FPG, 2-h PG during 75-g OGTT, and A1C are each appropriate ( Table 2.1  and Table 2.2 ). B 2.13 When using OGTT as a screen for prediabetes or diabetes, adequate carbohydrate intake (at least 150 g/day) should be assured for 3 days prior to testing. A 2.14 Risk-based screening for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes should be considered after the onset of puberty or after 10 years of age, whichever occurs earlier, in children and adolescents with overweight (BMI ≥85th percentile) or obesity (BMI ≥95th percentile) and who have one or more risk factors for diabetes. (See Table 2.5  for evidence grading of risk factors.) B 2.15a Consider screening people for prediabetes or diabetes if on certain medications, such as glucocorticoids, statins, thiazide diuretics, some HIV medications, and second-generation antipsychotic medications, as these agents are known to increase the risk of these conditions. E 2.15b In people who are prescribed second-generation antipsychotic medications, screen for prediabetes and diabetes at baseline and repeat 12–16 weeks after medication initiation or sooner, if clinically indicated, and annually. B 2.16 People with HIV should be screened for diabetes and prediabetes with an FPG test before starting antiretroviral therapy, at the time of switching antiretroviral therapy, and 3–6 months after starting or switching antiretroviral therapy. If initial screening results are normal, FPG should be checked annually. E \\n \\n Criteria for screening for diabetes or prediabetes in asymptomatic adults 1. Testing should be considered in adults with overweight or obesity (BMI ≥25 kg/m 2 or ≥23 kg/m 2 in Asian American individuals) who have one or more of the following risk factors:   • First-degree relative with diabetes   • High-risk race and ethnicity (e.g., African American, Latino, Native American, Asian American, Pacific Islander)   • History of cardiovascular disease   • Hypertension (≥130/80 mmHg or on therapy for hypertension)   • HDL cholesterol level &lt;35 mg/dL (&lt;0.9 mmol/L) and/or a triglyceride level &gt;250 mg/dL (&gt;2.8 mmol/L)   • Individuals with polycystic ovary syndrome   • Physical inactivity   • Other clinical conditions associated with insulin resistance (e.g., severe obesity, acanthosis nigricans)  2. People with prediabetes (A1C ≥5.7% [≥39 mmol/mol], IGT, or IFG) should be tested yearly.  3. People who were diagnosed with GDM should have lifelong testing at least every 3 years.  4. For all other people, testing should begin at age 35 years.  5. If results are normal, testing should be repeated at a minimum of 3-year intervals, with consideration of more frequent testing depending on initial results and risk status.  6. People with HIV, exposure to high-risk medicines, history of pancreatitis  1. Testing should be considered in adults with overweight or obesity (BMI ≥25 kg/m 2 or ≥23 kg/m 2 in Asian American individuals) who have one or more of the following risk factors:   • First-degree relative with diabetes   • High-risk race and ethnicity (e.g., African American, Latino, Native American, Asian American, Pacific Islander)   • History of cardiovascular disease   • Hypertension (≥130/80 mmHg or on therapy for hypertension)   • HDL cholesterol level &lt;35 mg/dL (&lt;0.9 mmol/L) and/or a triglyceride level &gt;250 mg/dL (&gt;2.8 mmol/L)   • Individuals with polycystic ovary syndrome   • Physical inactivity   • Other clinical conditions associated with insulin resistance (e.g., severe obesity, acanthosis nigricans)  2. People with prediabetes (A1C ≥5.7% [≥39 mmol/mol], IGT, or IFG) should be tested yearly.  3. People who were diagnosed with GDM should have lifelong testing at least every 3 years.  4. For all other people, testing should begin at age 35 years.  5. If results are normal, testing should be repeated at a minimum of 3-year intervals, with consideration of more frequent testing depending on initial results and risk status.  6. People with HIV, exposure to high-risk medicines, history of pancreatitis  GDM, gestational diabetes mellitus; IFG, impaired fasting glucose; IGT, impaired glucose tolerance. \\n Risk-based screening for type 2 diabetes or prediabetes in asymptomatic children and adolescents in a clinical setting Screening should be considered in youth* who have overweight (≥85th percentile) or obesity (≥95th percentile) A and who have one or more additional risk factors based on the strength of their association with diabetes:   • Maternal history of diabetes or GDM during the child’s gestation A    • Family history of type 2 diabetes in first- or second-degree relative A    • Race and ethnicity (e.g., Native American, African American, Latino, Asian American, Pacific Islander) A    • Signs of insulin resistance or conditions associated with insulin resistance (acanthosis nigricans, hypertension, dyslipidemia, polycystic ovary syndrome, or small-for-gestational-age birth weight) B   Screening should be considered in youth* who have overweight (≥85th percentile) or obesity (≥95th percentile) A and who have one or more additional risk factors based on the strength of their association with diabetes:   • Maternal history of diabetes or GDM during the child’s gestation A    • Family history of type 2 diabetes in first- or second-degree relative A    • Race and ethnicity (e.g., Native American, African American, Latino, Asian American, Pacific Islander) A    • Signs of insulin resistance or conditions associated with insulin resistance (acanthosis nigricans, hypertension, dyslipidemia, polycystic ovary syndrome, or small-for-gestational-age birth weight) B   GDM, gestational diabetes mellitus. After the onset of puberty or after 10 years of age, whichever occurs earlier. If tests are normal, repeat testing at a minimum of 3-year intervals (or more frequently if BMI is increasing or risk factor profile is deteriorating) is recommended. Reports of type 2 diabetes before age 10 years exist, and this can be considered with numerous risk factors. \\n \\n Prediabetes \\n \\n Prediabetes is the term used for individuals whose glucose or A1C levels do not meet the criteria for diabetes yet have abnormal carbohydrate metabolism that results in elevated glucose levels (dysglycemia) intermediate between normoglycemia and diabetes (28,80). People with prediabetes are defined by the presence of IFG and/or IGT and/or A1C 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol) ( Table 2.2 ). As prediabetes is an intermediate state between normoglycemia and diabetes, it is clearly a significant risk factor for progression to diabetes as well as cardiovascular disease and several other cardiometabolic outcomes. Criteria for screening for diabetes or prediabetes in asymptomatic adults are outlined in Table 2.4 . Prediabetes is associated with obesity (especially abdominal or visceral obesity), dyslipidemia with high triglycerides and/or low HDL cholesterol, and hypertension. The presence of prediabetes should prompt comprehensive screening for cardiovascular risk factors. \\n \\n Diagnosis of Prediabetes \\n \\n IFG is defined as FPG levels from 100 to 125 mg/dL (from 5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) (78,79) and IGT as 2-h PG levels during 75-g OGTT from 140 to 199 mg/dL (from 7.8 to 11.0 mmol/L) (10). It should be noted that the World Health Organization and a number of diabetes organizations define the IFG lower limit at 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L). The ADA also initially endorsed this IFG lower limit in 1997 (10). However, in 2003 the ADA adopted the new range of 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L) to better define IFG so that the population risk of developing diabetes with IFG would be similar to that with IGT (11). \\n As with the glucose measures, several prospective studies that used A1C to predict the progression to diabetes as defined by A1C criteria demonstrated a strong, continuous association between A1C and subsequent diabetes. In a systematic review of 44,203 individuals from 16 cohort studies with a follow-up interval averaging 5.6 years (range 2.8–12 years), those with A1C between 5.5% and 6.0% (between 37 and 42 mmol/mol) had a substantially increased risk of diabetes (5-year incidence from 9% to 25%). Those with an A1C range of 6.0–6.5% (42–48 mmol/mol) had a 5-year risk of developing diabetes between 25% and 50% and a relative risk 20 times higher than that with A1C of 5.0% (31 mmol/mol) (81). In a community-based study of African American and non-Hispanic White adults without diabetes, baseline A1C was a stronger predictor of subsequent diabetes and cardiovascular events than fasting glucose (82). Other analyses suggest that A1C of 5.7% (39 mmol/mol) or higher is associated with a diabetes risk similar to that of the high-risk participants in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) (83), and A1C at baseline was a strong predictor of the development of glucose-defined diabetes during the DPP and its follow-up (7). \\n An A1C range of 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol) identifies a group of individuals at high risk for diabetes and cardiovascular outcomes. Similar to those with IFG and/or IGT, individuals with A1C of 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol) should be informed of their increased risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease and counseled about effective strategies to lower their risks (see Section 3, “ Prevention or Delay of Diabetes and Associated Comorbidities ”). Similar to glucose measurements, the continuum of risk is continuous: as A1C rises, the diabetes risk rises disproportionately (81). Aggressive interventions and vigilant follow-up should be pursued for those considered at very high risk (e.g., those with A1C &gt;6.0% [&gt;42 mmol/mol] and individuals with both IFG and IGT). \\n Table 2.4  outlines the criteria for screening for prediabetes. The ADA risk test is an additional option for assessment to determine the appropriateness of screening for diabetes or prediabetes in asymptomatic adults ( Fig. 2.2 ) (online at diabetes.org/socrisktest). For additional background regarding risk factors and screening for prediabetes, see and , below. For details regarding individuals with prediabetes most likely to benefit from a formal behavioral or lifestyle intervention, see Section 3, “ Prevention or Delay of Diabetes and Associated Comorbidities.” \\n Figure 2.2 \\n \\n Type 2 Diabetes \\n \\n Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90–95% of all diabetes. This form encompasses individuals who generally have relative (rather than absolute) insulin deficiency and have peripheral insulin resistance (i.e., decreased biological response to insulin). \\n There are various causes of type 2 diabetes. Although the specific etiologies are not known, autoimmune destruction of β-cells does not occur, and individuals do not have any of the other known causes of diabetes. Most, but not all, people with type 2 diabetes have overweight or obesity. Excess weight itself causes some degree of insulin resistance. Individuals who do not have obesity or overweight by traditional weight criteria may have an increased percentage of body fat distributed predominantly in the abdominal region, including sites involved in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (also known as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease) and/or ectopic sites (e.g., skeletal muscle). \\n DKA seldom occurs spontaneously in type 2 diabetes; when seen, it usually arises in individuals already treated with insulin (e.g., missed or inadequate doses), in people with ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes, in association with the stress of another illness such as infection (e.g., COVID-19) or myocardial infarction, or in association with illicit drug use (e.g., cocaine) or with the use of certain medications such as glucocorticoids, second-generation antipsychotics, or sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (84,85). Type 2 diabetes frequently goes undiagnosed for many years, because hyperglycemia develops gradually and, at earlier stages, is often not severe enough for the individual to notice the classic diabetes symptoms caused by hyperglycemia, such as dehydration or unintentional weight loss. Nevertheless, even undiagnosed people with diabetes are at increased risk of developing macrovascular and microvascular complications. \\n People with type 2 diabetes early in the disease course may have insulin levels that appear normal or elevated, yet the failure to normalize blood glucose reflects a relative defect in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion that is insufficient to compensate for insulin resistance. Insulin resistance may improve with weight reduction, physical activity, and/or pharmacologic treatment of hyperglycemia but is seldom restored to normal. Recent interventions with intensive diet and exercise, newer pharmacological agents (e.g., glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists), or surgical weight loss have led to diabetes remission (86–92) (see Section 8, “ Obesity and Weight Management for the Prevention and Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes ”). \\n The risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases with age, obesity, and lack of physical activity (93,94). It occurs more frequently in individuals with prediabetes, prior gestational diabetes mellitus, or polycystic ovary syndrome. It is also more common in people with hypertension or dyslipidemia and in certain racial and ethnic subgroups (e.g., African American, Native American, Hispanic/Latino, and Asian American). It is often associated with a strong genetic predisposition or family history in first-degree relatives (more so than type 1 diabetes). However, the genetics of type 2 diabetes are poorly understood and under intense investigation in this era of precision medicine (52). In adults without traditional risk factors for type 2 diabetes and/or of younger age, consider islet autoantibody testing (e.g., GAD autoantibodies) to exclude the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (36) ( Fig. 2.1 ). \\n \\n Screening and Testing for Prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes in Asymptomatic Adults \\n \\n Screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes risk through a targeted assessment of risk factors ( Table 2.4 ) or with an assessment tool, such as the ADA risk test ( Fig. 2.2 ) (online at diabetes.org/socrisktest), is recommended to guide health care professionals on whether performing a diagnostic test ( Table 2.1 ) is appropriate. Prediabetes and type 2 diabetes meet criteria for conditions in which early detection via screening is appropriate. Both conditions are common and impose significant clinical and public health burdens. There is often a long presymptomatic phase before the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Simple tests to detect preclinical disease are readily available (95). The duration of glycemic burden is a strong predictor of adverse outcomes. There are effective interventions that prevent progression from prediabetes to diabetes. It is important to individualize risk-to-benefit ratio of formal intervention for people with prediabetes and consider person-centered goals. Risk models have explored the benefit, in general finding higher benefit of intervention in those at highest risk (96) (see Section 3, “ Prevention or Delay of Diabetes and Associated Comorbidities ”) and reduce the risk of diabetes complications (97) (see Section 10, “ Cardiovascular Disease and Risk Management,” Section 11, “ Chronic Kidney Disease and Risk Management,” and Section 12, “ Retinopathy, Neuropathy, and Foot Care ”). In the most recent National Institutes of Health (NIH) Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) report, prevention of progression from prediabetes to diabetes (98) resulted in lower rates of developing retinopathy and nephropathy (99). Similar impact on diabetes complications was reported with screening, diagnosis, and comprehensive risk factor management in the U.K. Clinical Practice Research Datalink database (97). In that report, progression from prediabetes to diabetes augmented risk of complications. \\n Despite the numerous benefits of screening and early diagnosis for prediabetes or diabetes, unfortunately many people in the U.S. and globally either remain undiagnosed or are diagnosed late, when complications have already arisen. \\n Additional considerations regarding testing for type 2 diabetes and prediabetes in asymptomatic individuals are described below. \\n \\n Age \\n \\n Age is a major risk factor for diabetes. Testing should begin at no later than age 35 years for all people (100). Screening should be considered in adults of any age with overweight or obesity and one or more risk factors for diabetes. \\n \\n Medications \\n \\n Certain medications, such as glucocorticoids, statins (101), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, some HIV medications (19), and second-generation antipsychotic medications (102), should be considered when deciding whether to screen for prediabetes or diabetes, as these medications are known to increase the risks of these conditions. \\n For example, people taking second-generation antipsychotic medications, such as olanzapine, require greater monitoring because of an increase in risk of type 2 diabetes associated with this medication (102). There is a range of effects on metabolic parameters (e.g., glucose concentration, hyperglycemia, and weight gain) across second-generation antipsychotic medications; aripiprazole and ziprasidone tend to have fewer metabolic effects, and haloperidol, clozapine, quetiapine, and risperidone tend to have more metabolic effects. People treated with these agents should be screened for prediabetes or diabetes at baseline, rescreened 12–16 weeks after medication initiation, and screened annually thereafter (102). \\n \\n People With HIV \\n \\n People with HIV are at higher risk for developing prediabetes and diabetes on antiretroviral (ARV) therapies; a screening protocol is therefore recommended (103). The A1C test may underestimate glycemia in people with HIV; it is not recommended for diagnosis and may present challenges for monitoring (20). In those with prediabetes, weight loss through healthy nutrition and physical activity may reduce the progression toward diabetes. Among people with HIV and diabetes, preventive health care using an approach used in people without HIV is critical to reduce the risks of microvascular and macrovascular complications. Diabetes risk is increased with certain protease inhibitors (PIs) and nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). New-onset diabetes is estimated to occur in more than 5% of individuals infected with HIV on PIs, whereas more than 15% may have prediabetes (104). \\n PIs are associated with insulin resistance and may also lead to apoptosis of pancreatic β-cells. NRTIs also affect fat distribution (both lipohypertrophy and lipoatrophy), which is associated with insulin resistance. For people with HIV and ARV-associated hyperglycemia, it may be appropriate to consider discontinuing the problematic ARV agents if safe and effective alternatives are available (105). Before making ARV substitutions, carefully consider the possible effect on HIV virological control and the potential adverse effects of new ARV agents. In some cases, antihyperglycemic agents may still be necessary. \\n \\n Testing Interval \\n \\n The appropriate interval between screening tests is not known (106). The rationale for the 3-year interval is that with this interval, the number of false-positive tests that require confirmatory testing will be reduced, and individuals with false-negative tests will be retested before substantial time elapses and complications develop (106). In especially high-risk individuals, particularly with weight gain, shorter intervals between screenings may be useful. \\n \\n Community Screening \\n \\n Ideally, screening should be carried out within a health care setting because of the need for follow-up and treatment. Community screening outside a health care setting is generally not recommended because people with positive tests may not seek, or have access to, appropriate follow-up testing and care. However, in specific situations where an adequate referral system is established beforehand for positive tests, community screening may be considered. Community screening may also be poorly targeted; i.e., it may fail to reach the groups most at risk and inappropriately test those at very low risk or even those who have already been diagnosed (107). \\n \\n Screening in Dental Practices \\n \\n Because periodontal disease is associated with diabetes, the utility of screening in a dental setting and referral to primary care as a means to improve the diagnosis of prediabetes and diabetes has been explored (108–110), with one study estimating that 30% of individuals ≥30 years of age seen in general dental practices (including people with and without periodontal disease) had newly diagnosed dysglycemia (110). A similar study in 1,150 dental patients &gt;40 years old in India reported 20.7% and 14.6% meeting criteria for prediabetes and diabetes, respectively, using random blood glucose (111). Further research is needed to demonstrate the feasibility, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of screening in this setting. \\n \\n Screening and Testing for Prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes in Children and Adolescents \\n \\n The epidemiologic studies that formed the basis for recommending A1C to diagnose diabetes included only adult populations (112). However, recent ADA clinical guidance concluded that A1C, FPG, or 2-h PG could be used to test for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents (113). \\n In the last decade, the incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents has increased dramatically, especially in racial and ethnic minority populations (114). See Table 2.5  for recommendations on risk-based screening for type 2 diabetes or prediabetes in asymptomatic children and adolescents in a clinical setting (113). See Table 2.1  and Table 2.2  for the criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes and prediabetes, respectively, that apply to children, adolescents, and adults. See Section 14, “ Children and Adolescents,” for additional information on type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents. \\n \\n Pancreatic Diabetes or Diabetes in the Context of Disease of the Exocrine Pancreas \\n Recommendation \\n \\n \\n 2.17 Screen people for diabetes within 3–6 months following an episode of acute pancreatitis and annually thereafter. Screening for diabetes is recommended annually for people with chronic pancreatitis. E \\n \\n Pancreatic diabetes (also termed pancreatogenic diabetes or type 3c diabetes) includes both structural and functional loss of glucose-normalizing insulin secretion in the context of exocrine pancreatic dysfunction and is commonly misdiagnosed as type 2 diabetes. The diverse set of etiologies includes pancreatitis (acute and chronic), trauma or pancreatectomy, neoplasia, cystic fibrosis (addressed later in this section), hemochromatosis, fibrocalculous pancreatopathy, rare genetic disorders, and idiopathic forms (2); as such, pancreatic diabetes is the preferred umbrella term (115). \\n Pancreatitis, even a single bout, can lead to postpancreatitis diabetes mellitus. Both acute and chronic pancreatitis can lead to postpancreatitis diabetes mellitus, and the risk is highest with recurrent bouts. A distinguishing feature is concurrent pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (consider screening individuals with acute and chronic pancreatitis for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency by measuring fecal elastase), pathological pancreatic imaging (endoscopic ultrasound, MRI, and computed tomography), and absence of type 1 diabetes–associated autoimmunity (116–120). There is loss of both insulin and glucagon secretion and often higher-than-expected insulin requirements. Risk for microvascular complications appears to be similar to that of other forms of diabetes. \\n For people with pancreatitis and diabetes, therapy should be advanced if A1C goals are not met. Glucose-lowering therapies associated with increased risk of pancreatitis (i.e., incretin-based therapies) should be avoided. Early initiation of insulin therapy should be considered. In the context of pancreatectomy, islet autotransplantation can be considered for selected individuals with medically refractory chronic pancreatitis in specialized centers to preserve endogenous islet function and insulin secretion (121,122). In some cases, autotransplant can lead to insulin independence. In others, it may decrease insulin requirements (123). \\n \\n Cystic Fibrosis–Related Diabetes \\n Recommendations \\n \\n \\n 2.18 Annual screening for cystic fibrosis–related diabetes (CFRD) with an OGTT should begin by age 10 years in all people with cystic fibrosis not previously diagnosed with CFRD. B 2.19 A1C is not recommended as a screening test for CFRD due to low sensitivity. However, a value of ≥6.5% (≥48 mmol/mol) is consistent with a diagnosis of CFRD. B 2.20 Beginning 5 years after the diagnosis of CFRD, annual monitoring for complications of diabetes is recommended. E \\n \\n Cystic fibrosis is a multisystem condition arising from recessive mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. Pancreatic exocrine damage ultimately manifests as pancreatic exocrine insufficiency that begins as early as infancy (124). Cystic fibrosis–related diabetes (CFRD) is the most common comorbidity in people with cystic fibrosis, occurring in about 20% of adolescents and 40–50% of adults (125). The relevance of CFRD is highlighted by its association with increased morbidity, mortality, and patient burden. Diabetes in this population, compared with individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, is associated with worse nutritional status, more severe inflammatory lung disease, and greater mortality. Insulin insufficiency is the primary defect in CFRD. Genetically determined β-cell function and insulin resistance associated with infection and inflammation may also contribute to the development of CFRD. Milder abnormalities of glucose tolerance are even more common and occur at earlier ages than CFRD. Whether individuals with IGT should be treated with insulin replacement has not currently been determined. Although screening for diabetes before the age of 10 years can identify risk for progression to CFRD in those with abnormal glucose tolerance, no benefit has been established with respect to weight, height, BMI, or lung function. OGTT is the recommended screening test for CFRD. Not unexpectedly, annual OGTTs are perceived as burdensome, and adherence to current CFRD screening guidelines is poor, with only 30% of adults with cystic fibrosis having annual OGTTs (126). A1C is not recommended for screening due to low sensitivity; however, a value ≥6.5% (≥48 mmol/mol) is consistent with a diagnosis of CFRD and reduces patient screening burden (127–129). Regardless of age, weight loss or failure of expected weight gain is a risk for CFRD and should prompt screening (127,128). The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry (130) evaluated 3,553 people with cystic fibrosis and diagnosed 445 (13%) with CFRD. Early diagnosis and treatment of CFRD was associated with preservation of lung function. The European Cystic Fibrosis Society Patient Registry reported an increase in CFRD with age (10% increase per decade), genotype, decreased lung function, and female sex (131,132). CGM or HOMA of β-cell function (133) may be more sensitive than OGTT to detect risk for progression to CFRD; however, evidence linking these results to long-term outcomes is lacking, and these tests are not recommended for screening outside the research setting (134). \\n CFRD mortality has significantly decreased over time, and the gap in mortality between people with cystic fibrosis with and without diabetes has considerably narrowed (135). There are limited clinical trial data on therapy for CFRD. People with CFRD should be treated with insulin to attain individualized glycemic goals. \\n Additional resources for the clinical management of CFRD can be found in the position statement “Clinical Care Guidelines for Cystic Fibrosis–Related Diabetes” (136) and in the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes 2018 clinical practice consensus guidelines (125). \\n \\n Posttransplantation Diabetes Mellitus \\n Recommendations \\n \\n \\n 2.21 After organ transplantation, screening for hyperglycemia should be done. A formal diagnosis of posttransplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is best made once the individual is stable on an immunosuppressive plan and in the absence of an acute infection. B 2.22 The OGTT is the preferred test to make a diagnosis of PTDM. B 2.23 Immunosuppressive plans shown to provide the best outcomes for individuals and graft survival should be used, irrespective of PTDM risk. E \\n \\n Several terms are used in the literature to describe the presence of diabetes following organ transplantation (137). New-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) is one such designation that describes individuals who develop new-onset diabetes following transplant. NODAT excludes people with pretransplant diabetes that was undiagnosed as well as posttransplant hyperglycemia that resolves by the time of discharge (138). Another term, posttransplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM) (138,139), describes the presence of diabetes in the posttransplant setting irrespective of the timing of diabetes onset (140). The clinical importance of PTDM lies in its unquestionable impact as a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease in solid-organ transplantation (137). \\n Hyperglycemia is very common during the early posttransplant period, with ∼90% of kidney allograft recipients exhibiting hyperglycemia in the first few weeks following transplant (138,139,141,142). In most cases, such stress- or steroid-induced hyperglycemia resolves by the time of discharge (142,143). Although the use of immunosuppressive therapies is a major contributor to the development of PTDM, the risks of transplant rejection outweigh the risks of PTDM, and the role of the diabetes health care professional is to treat hyperglycemia appropriately regardless of the type of immunosuppression (138). Risk factors for PTDM include both general diabetes risks (such as age, family history of diabetes, obesity, etc.) and transplant-specific factors, such as use of immunosuppressant agents (144–146). Whereas posttransplantation hyperglycemia is an important risk factor for subsequent PTDM, a formal diagnosis of PTDM is optimally made once the individual is stable on maintenance immunosuppression (usually at least 45 days after transplantation) and in the absence of acute infection (138,142–144,147). \\n The OGTT is considered the gold-standard test for the diagnosis of PTDM (1 year posttransplant) (138,139,148,149). Pretransplant elevation in hs-CRP was associated with PTDM in the setting of renal transplant (150,151). However, screening people with FPG and/or A1C can identify high-risk individuals who require further assessment and may reduce the number of overall OGTTs required. \\n Few randomized controlled studies have reported on the short- and long-term use of antihyperglycemic agents in the setting of PTDM (144,152,153). Most studies have reported that transplant patients with hyperglycemia and PTDM after transplantation have higher rates of rejection, infection, and rehospitalization (142,144,154). Insulin therapy is the agent of choice for the management of hyperglycemia, PTDM, preexisting diabetes, and diabetes in the hospital setting and can be continued postdischarge. No studies to date have firmly established which noninsulin agents are safest or most efficacious in PTDM. The choice of agent is usually made based on the side effect profile of the medication, possible interactions with the individual’s immunosuppression plan, and potential cardiovascular and renal benefits in individuals with PTDM (144). Well-designed intervention trials examining the efficacy and safety of these and other antihyperglycemic agents in people with PTDM are needed. \\n \\n Monogenic Diabetes Syndromes \\n Recommendations \\n \\n \\n 2.24a Regardless of current age, all people diagnosed with diabetes in the first 6 months of life should have immediate genetic testing for neonatal diabetes. A 2.24b Children and young adults who do not have typical characteristics of type 1 or type 2 diabetes and who often have a family history of diabetes in successive generations (suggestive of an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance) should have genetic testing for maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). A 2.24c In both instances, consultation with a center specializing in diabetes genetics is recommended to understand the significance of genetic mutations and how best to approach further evaluation, treatment, and genetic counseling. E \\n \\n Monogenic defects that cause β-cell dysfunction, such as neonatal diabetes and MODY, are present in a small fraction of people with diabetes (&lt;5%) (155).

Neonatal diabetes occurs much less often after 6 months of age, whereas autoimmune type 1 diabetes rarely occurs before 6 months of age. Neonatal diabetes can either be transient or permanent. Transient diabetes is most often due to overexpression of genes on chromosome 6q24, is recurrent in about half of cases, and may be treatable with medications other than insulin. Permanent neonatal diabetes is most commonly due to autosomal dominant mutations in the genes encoding the Kir6.2 subunit ( KCNJ11) and SUR1 subunit ( ABCC8) of the β-cell K ATP channel. A recent report details a de novo mutation in EIF2B1 affecting eIF2 signaling associated with permanent neonatal diabetes and hepatic dysfunction, similar to Wolcott-Rallison syndrome but with few severe comorbidities (161). The recent ADA-European Association for the Study of Diabetes type 1 diabetes consensus report recommends that regardless of current age, individuals diagnosed under 6 months of age should have genetic testing (36). Correct diagnosis has critical implications, because 30–50% of people with K ATP -related neonatal diabetes will exhibit improved blood glucose levels when treated with high-dose oral sulfonylureas instead of insulin. Insulin gene ( INS) mutations are the second most common cause of permanent neonatal diabetes, and while intensive insulin management is currently the preferred treatment strategy, there are important genetic counseling considerations, as most of the mutations that cause diabetes are dominantly inherited. \\n \\n Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young \\n \\n MODY is frequently characterized by onset of hyperglycemia at an early age (classically before age 25 years, although diagnosis may occur at older ages). MODY is characterized by impaired insulin secretion with minimal or no defects in insulin action (in the absence of coexistent obesity). It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with abnormalities in at least 13 genes on different chromosomes identified to date (162). The most commonly reported forms are GCK-MODY (MODY2), HNF1A-MODY (MODY3), and HNF4A-MODY (MODY1). \\n For individuals with MODY, the treatment implications are considerable and warrant genetic testing (163,164). Clinically, people with GCK-MODY exhibit mild, stable fasting hyperglycemia and do not require antihyperglycemic therapy, although it is commonly needed during pregnancy. Individuals with HNF1A-MODY or HNF4A-MODY usually respond well to low doses of sulfonylureas, which are considered first-line therapy; in some instances, insulin will be required over time. Mutations or deletions in HNF1B are associated with renal cysts and uterine malformations (renal cysts and diabetes [RCAD] syndrome). Other extremely rare forms of MODY have been reported to involve other transcription factor genes, including PDX1 ( IPF1) and NEUROD1. \\n \\n Diagnosis of Monogenic Diabetes \\n \\n A diagnosis of one of the three most common forms of MODY, including HNF1A-MODY, GCK-MODY, and HNF4A-MODY, allows for more cost-effective personalized therapy (i.e., no therapy for GCK-MODY and sulfonylureas as first-line therapy for HNF1A-MODY and HNF4A-MODY). Additionally, diagnosis can lead to identification of other affected family members and can indicate potential extrapancreatic complications in affected individuals. Genetic screening (i.e., next-generation sequencing) is increasingly available and cost-effective (161,163). \\n A diagnosis of MODY should be considered in individuals who have atypical diabetes and multiple family members with diabetes not characteristic of type 1 or type 2 diabetes, although admittedly, atypical diabetes is becoming increasingly difficult to precisely define in the absence of a definitive set of tests for either type of diabetes (158–160,163–169) ( Fig. 2.1 ). In most cases, the presence of autoantibodies for type 1 diabetes precludes further testing for monogenic diabetes, but the presence of autoantibodies in people with monogenic diabetes has been reported (170). Individuals in whom monogenic diabetes is suspected should be referred to a specialist for further evaluation. Readily available commercial genetic testing following the criteria listed below now enables a cost-effective (170), often cost-saving, genetic diagnosis that is increasingly supported by health insurance. A biomarker screening pathway, such as the combination of urinary C-peptide/creatinine ratio and antibody screening, may aid in determining who should get genetic testing for MODY (171). It is critical to correctly diagnose one of the monogenic forms of diabetes, because these individuals may be incorrectly diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, leading to suboptimal, even potentially harmful, treatment plans and delays in diagnosing other family members (172). The correct diagnosis is especially critical for those with GCK-MODY mutations, where multiple studies have shown that no complications ensue in the absence of glucose-lowering therapy (173). It has been reported that low hs-CRP can be used in identifying those more likely to have HNF1A-MODY as opposed to other forms of diabetes, supporting genetic testing in such individuals (174). The risks of microvascular and macrovascular complications with HNF1A-MODY and HNF4A-MODY are similar to those observed in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes (175,176). Genetic counseling is recommended to ensure that affected individuals understand the patterns of inheritance and the importance of a correct diagnosis and to address comprehensive cardiovascular risk. \\n \\n The diagnosis of monogenic diabetes should be considered in children and adults diagnosed with diabetes in early adulthood with the following findings: Diabetes diagnosed within the first 6 months of life (with occasional cases presenting later, mostly INS and ABCC8 mutations) (157,177) Diabetes without typical features of type 1 or type 2 diabetes (negative diabetes-associated autoantibodies, no obesity, and lacking other metabolic features, especially with strong family history of diabetes) Stable, mild fasting hyperglycemia (100–150 mg/dL [5.6–8.5 mmol/L]), stable A1C between 5.6% and 7.6% (between 38 and 60 mmol/mol), especially if no obesity \\n \\n \\n Gestational Diabetes Mellitus \\n Recommendations \\n \\n 2.25 In individuals who are planning pregnancy, screen those with risk factors ( Table 2.4 ) B and consider testing all individuals of childbearing potential for undiagnosed prediabetes or diabetes. E 2.26a Before 15 weeks of gestation, test individuals with risk factors ( Table 2.4 ) B and consider testing all individuals E for undiagnosed diabetes at the first prenatal visit using standard diagnostic criteria if not screened preconception. 2.26b Before 15 weeks of gestation, screen for abnormal glucose metabolism to identify individuals who are at higher risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes, are more likely to need insulin, and are at high risk of a later gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) diagnosis. B Early treatment for individuals with abnormal glucose metabolism may provide some benefit. E 2.26c Screen for early abnormal glucose metabolism with dysglycemia using FPG of 110–125 mg/dL (6.1–6.9 mmol/L) or A1C 5.9–6.4% (41–47 mmol/mol). B 2.27 Screen for GDM at 24–28 weeks of gestation in pregnant individuals not previously found to have diabetes or high-risk abnormal glucose metabolism detected earlier in the current pregnancy. A 2.28 Screen individuals with GDM for prediabetes or diabetes at 4–12 weeks postpartum, using the 75-g OGTT and clinically appropriate nonpregnancy diagnostic criteria. A 2.29 Individuals with a history of GDM should have lifelong screening for the development of prediabetes or diabetes at least every 3 years. B \\n \\n Definition \\n \\n For many years, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was defined as any degree of glucose intolerance that was first recognized during pregnancy (81), regardless of the degree of hyperglycemia. This definition facilitated a uniform strategy for detection and classification of GDM, but this definition has serious limitations (178). First, the best available evidence reveals that many cases of GDM represent preexisting hyperglycemia that is detected by routine screening in pregnancy, as routine screening is not widely performed in nonpregnant individuals of reproductive age. It is the severity of hyperglycemia that is clinically important regarding both short- and long-term maternal and fetal risks. \\n The ongoing epidemic of obesity and diabetes has led to more type 2 diabetes in people of reproductive age, with an increase in the number of pregnant individuals with undiagnosed type 2 diabetes in early pregnancy (179–181). Ideally, undiagnosed diabetes should be identified preconception in individuals with risk factors or in high-risk populations (182–187), as the preconception care of people with preexisting diabetes results in lower A1C and reduced risk of birth defects, preterm delivery, perinatal mortality, small-for-gestational-age birth weight, and neonatal intensive care unit admission (188). If individuals are not screened prior to pregnancy, universal early screening at &lt;15 weeks of gestation for undiagnosed diabetes may be considered over selective screening ( Table 2.4 ), particularly in populations with high prevalence of risk factors and undiagnosed diabetes in people of childbearing age. Strong racial and ethnic disparities exist in the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes. Therefore, early screening provides an initial step to identify these health disparities so that they can begin to be addressed (184–187). Standard diagnostic criteria for identifying undiagnosed diabetes in early pregnancy are the same as those used in the nonpregnant population ( Table 2.1 ). Individuals found to have diabetes by the standard diagnostic criteria used outside of pregnancy should be classified as having diabetes complicating pregnancy (most often type 2 diabetes, rarely type 1 diabetes or monogenic diabetes) and managed accordingly. \\n Early abnormal glucose metabolism, defined as a fasting glucose threshold of 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L) or an A1C of 5.9% (41 mmol/mol), may identify individuals who are at higher risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes (preeclampsia, macrosomia, shoulder dystocia, and perinatal death), are more likely to need insulin treatment, and are at high risk of a later GDM diagnosis (189–194). An A1C threshold of 5.7% has not been shown to be associated with adverse perinatal outcomes (195,196). \\n If early screening is negative, individuals should be rescreened for GDM between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation (see Section 15, “ Management of Diabetes in Pregnancy ”). The International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) GDM diagnostic criteria for the 75-g OGTT, as well as the GDM screening and diagnostic criteria used in the two-step approach, were not derived from data in the first half of pregnancy and should not be used for early screening (197). To date, most randomized controlled trials of treatment of early abnormal glucose metabolism have been underpowered for outcomes. A recent randomized controlled trial performed at 17 centers administered early screening (mean 15.6 ± 2.5 weeks) for GDM with a 75-g OGTT. Individuals who met World Health Organization criteria for GDM were randomized to receive early treatment or a repeat OGTT at 24–28 weeks (with deferred treatment if indicated). The first primary outcome measure was an adverse neonatal composite outcome including birth &lt;37 weeks, birth weight ≥4.5 kg, birth trauma, neonatal respiratory distress within 24 h of birth, phototherapy, stillbirth neonatal death, or shoulder dystocia. Early GDM treatment resulted in a significant but modest improvement in the composite adverse neonatal outcome (24.9% early treatment vs. 30.5% control, relative risk 0.82 [0.68–0.98]), with a suggestion of more benefit (per prespecified subgroup analyses) among individuals who had the OGTT at &lt;14 weeks and among individuals with glycemic values in higher ranges on their OGTTs (198). Therefore, the benefits of treatment for early abnormal glucose metabolism remain uncertain. Nutrition counseling and periodic “block” testing of glucose levels weekly to identify individuals with high glucose levels are suggested. Testing frequency may proceed to daily, and treatment may be intensified, if the FPG is predominantly &gt;110 mg/dL (&gt;6.1 mmol/L) prior to 18 weeks of gestation. \\n Both the FPG and A1C are low-cost tests. An advantage of the A1C test is its convenience, as it can be added to the prenatal laboratories and does not require an early-morning fasting appointment. Disadvantages include inaccuracies in the presence of increased red blood cell turnover and hemoglobinopathies (usually reads lower) and higher values with anemia and reduced red blood cell turnover (199). A1C is not reliable for screening for GDM or for preexisting diabetes at 15 weeks of gestation or later; if the first screening takes place at this stage, one cannot differentiate between preexisting diabetes and GDM with an A1C. \\n GDM is often indicative of underlying β-cell dysfunction (200), which confers marked increased risk for later development of diabetes, generally but not always type 2 diabetes, in the mother after delivery (201,202). As effective prevention interventions are available (203,204), individuals diagnosed with GDM should receive lifelong screening for prediabetes to allow interventions to reduce diabetes risk and for type 2 diabetes to allow treatment at the earliest possible time (205). \\n \\n Diagnosis \\n \\n GDM carries risks for the mother, fetus, and neonate. The Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study (206), a large-scale multinational cohort study completed by more than 23,000 pregnant individuals, demonstrated that risk of adverse maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes continuously increased as a function of maternal glycemia at 24–28 weeks of gestation, even within ranges previously considered normal for pregnancy. For most complications, there was no threshold for risk. These results have led to careful reconsideration of the diagnostic criteria for GDM. \\n \\n GDM diagnosis ( Table 2.7 ) can be accomplished with either of two strategies: The “one-step” 75-g OGTT derived from the IADPSG criteria, or The older “two-step” approach with a 50-g (nonfasting) screen followed by a 100-g OGTT for those who screen positive based on the work of Carpenter-Coustan’s interpretation of the older O’Sullivan and Mahan (207) criteria. \\n \\n Screening for and diagnosis of GDM One-step strategy   Perform a 75-g OGTT, with plasma glucose measurement when an individual is fasting and at 1 and 2 h, at 24–28 weeks of gestation in individuals not previously diagnosed with diabetes.  The OGTT should be performed in the morning after an overnight fast of at least 8 h.  The diagnosis of GDM is made when any of the following plasma glucose values are met or exceeded:   • Fasting: 92 mg/dL (5.1 mmol/L)   • 1 h: 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L)   • 2 h: 153 mg/dL (8.5 mmol/L)  Two-step strategy   Step 1: Perform a 50-g GLT (nonfasting), with plasma glucose measurement at 1 h, at 24–28 weeks of gestation in individuals not previously diagnosed with diabetes.  If the plasma glucose level measured 1 h after the load is ≥130, 135, or 140 mg/dL (7.2, 7.5, or 7.8 mmol/L, respectively),* proceed to a 100-g OGTT.  Step 2: The 100-g OGTT should be performed when the individual is fasting.  The diagnosis of GDM is made when at least two† of the following four plasma glucose levels (measured fasting and at 1, 2, and 3 h during OGTT) are met or exceeded (Carpenter-Coustan criteria [226]):   • Fasting: 95 mg/dL (5.3 mmol/L)   • 1 h: 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L)   • 2 h: 155 mg/dL (8.6 mmol/L)   • 3 h: 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L)  One-step strategy   Perform a 75-g OGTT, with plasma glucose measurement when an individual is fasting and at 1 and 2 h, at 24–28 weeks of gestation in individuals not previously diagnosed with diabetes.  The OGTT should be performed in the morning after an overnight fast of at least 8 h.  The diagnosis of GDM is made when any of the following plasma glucose values are met or exceeded:   • Fasting: 92 mg/dL (5.1 mmol/L)   • 1 h: 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L)   • 2 h: 153 mg/dL (8.5 mmol/L)  Two-step strategy   Step 1: Perform a 50-g GLT (nonfasting), with plasma glucose measurement at 1 h, at 24–28 weeks of gestation in individuals not previously diagnosed with diabetes.  If the plasma glucose level measured 1 h after the load is ≥130, 135, or 140 mg/dL (7.2, 7.5, or 7.8 mmol/L, respectively),* proceed to a 100-g OGTT.  Step 2: The 100-g OGTT should be performed when the individual is fasting.  The diagnosis of GDM is made when at least two† of the following four plasma glucose levels (measured fasting and at 1, 2, and 3 h during OGTT) are met or exceeded (Carpenter-Coustan criteria [226]):   • Fasting: 95 mg/dL (5.3 mmol/L)   • 1 h: 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L)   • 2 h: 155 mg/dL (8.6 mmol/L)   • 3 h: 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L)  GDM, gestational diabetes mellitus; GLT, glucose load test; OGTT, oral glucose tolerance test. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends any of the commonly used thresholds of 130, 135, or 140 mg/dL for the 1-h 50-g GLT (222). ACOG notes that one elevated value can be used for diagnosis (222). \\n Different diagnostic criteria will identify different degrees of maternal hyperglycemia and maternal/fetal risk, leading some experts to debate, and disagree on, optimal strategies for the diagnosis of GDM. \\n \\n One-Step Strategy \\n \\n The IADPSG defined diagnostic cut points for GDM as the average fasting, 1-h, and 2-h PG values during a 75-g OGTT in individuals at 24–28 weeks of gestation who participated in the HAPO study at which odds for adverse outcomes reached 1.75 times the estimated odds of these outcomes at the mean fasting, 1-h, and 2-h PG levels of the study population. This one-step strategy was anticipated to significantly increase the incidence of GDM (from 5–6% to 15–20%), primarily because only one abnormal value, not two, became sufficient to make the diagnosis (208). Many regional studies have investigated the impact of adopting the IADPSG criteria on prevalence and have seen a roughly one- to threefold increase (209). The anticipated increase in the incidence of GDM could have a substantial impact on costs and medical infrastructure needs and has the potential to “medicalize” pregnancies previously categorized as normal. A follow-up study of individuals participating in a study of pregnancy OGTTs with glucose levels blinded to caregivers found that 11 years after their pregnancies, individuals who would have been diagnosed with GDM by the one-step approach, as compared with those without GDM, were at 3.4-fold higher risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and had children with a higher risk of obesity and increased body fat, suggesting that the larger group of individuals identified as having GDM by the one-step approach would benefit from the increased screening for diabetes and prediabetes after pregnancy (210). The ADA recommends the IADPSG diagnostic criteria with the intent of optimizing gestational outcomes, because these criteria are the only ones based on pregnancy outcomes rather than end points such as prediction of subsequent maternal diabetes. \\n The expected benefits of using IADPSG criteria to the offspring are inferred from intervention trials that focused on individuals with lower levels of hyperglycemia than those identified using older GDM diagnostic criteria. Those trials found modest benefits, including reduced rates of large-for-gestational-age births and preeclampsia (211,212). It is important to note that 80–90% of participants being treated for mild GDM in these two randomized controlled trials could be managed with lifestyle therapy alone. The OGTT glucose cutoffs in these two trials overlapped the thresholds recommended by the IADPSG, and in one trial (212), the 2-h PG threshold (140 mg/dL [7.8 mmol/L]) was lower than the cutoff recommended by the IADPSG (153 mg/dL [8.5 mmol/L]). \\n No randomized controlled trials of treating versus not treating GDM diagnosed by the IADPSG criteria but not the Carpenter-Coustan criteria have been published to date. However, a recent randomized trial of testing for GDM at 24–28 weeks of gestation by the one-step method using IADPSG criteria versus the two-step method using a 1-h 50-g glucose loading test (GLT) and, if positive, a 3-h OGTT by Carpenter-Coustan criteria identified twice as many individuals with GDM using the one-step method compared with the two-step method. Despite treating more individuals for GDM using the one-step method, there was no difference in pregnancy and perinatal complications (213). However, concerns have been raised about sample size estimates and unanticipated suboptimal engagement with the protocol regarding screening and treatment. For example, in the two-step group, 165 participants who did not get counted as having GDM were treated for isolated elevated FPG &gt;95 mg/dL (&gt;5.3 mmol/L) (214). The high prevalence of prediabetes in people of childbearing age may support the more inclusive IADPSG criteria. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data demonstrate a 21.5% prevalence of prediabetes in people of reproductive age of 20–44 years, which is comparable to or higher than the prevalence of GDM diagnosed by the one-step method (215). \\n The one-step method identifies the long-term risks of maternal prediabetes and diabetes and offspring abnormal glucose metabolism and adiposity. Post hoc GDM in individuals diagnosed by the one-step method in the HAPO cohort was associated with higher prevalence of IGT; higher 30-min, 1-h, and 2-h glucoses during the OGTT; and reduced insulin sensitivity and oral disposition index in their offspring at 10–14 years of age compared with offspring of mothers without GDM. Associations of mother’s fasting, 1-h, and 2-h values on the 75-g OGTT were continuous with a comprehensive panel of offspring metabolic outcomes (216,217). In addition, HAPO Follow-up Study (HAPO FUS) data demonstrate that neonatal adiposity and fetal hyperinsulinemia (cord C-peptide), both higher across the continuum of maternal hyperglycemia, are mediators of childhood body fat (218). \\n Data are lacking on how the treatment of mother’s hyperglycemia in pregnancy affects her offspring’s risk for obesity, diabetes, and other metabolic disorders (219,220). Additional well-designed clinical studies are needed to determine the optimal intensity of monitoring and treatment of individuals with GDM diagnosed by the one-step strategy. \\n \\n Two-Step Strategy \\n \\n In 2013, the NIH convened a consensus development conference to consider diagnostic criteria for diagnosing GDM (221). The 15-member panel had representatives from obstetrics and gynecology, maternal-fetal medicine, pediatrics, diabetes research, biostatistics, and other related fields. The panel recommended a two-step approach to screening that used a 1-h 50-g GLT followed by a 3-h 100-g OGTT for those who screened positive. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends any of the commonly used thresholds of 130, 135, or 140 mg/dL for the 1-h 50-g GLT (222). Updated from 2014, a 2021 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force systematic review continued to conclude that one-step versus two-step screening is associated with increased likelihood of GDM (11.5% vs. 4.9%) but without improved health outcomes. It reported that the oral glucose challenge test using thresholds of 140 or 135 mg/dL had sensitivities of 82% and 93% and specificities of 82% and 79%, respectively, against Carpenter-Coustan criteria. FPG cutoffs of 85 mg/dL and 90 mg/dL had sensitivities of 88% and 81% and specificities of 73% and 82%, respectively, against Carpenter-Coustan criteria (223). The use of A1C at 24–28 weeks of gestation as a screening test for GDM does not function as well as the GLT (224). \\n Key factors cited by the NIH panel in their decision-making process were the lack of clinical trial data demonstrating the benefits of the one-step strategy and the potential negative consequences of identifying a large group of individuals with GDM, including medicalization of pregnancy with increased health care utilization and costs. Moreover, screening with a 50-g GLT does not require fasting and therefore is easier to accomplish for many individuals. Treatment of higher-threshold maternal hyperglycemia, as identified by the two-step approach, reduces rates of neonatal macrosomia, large-for-gestational-age births (225), and shoulder dystocia without increasing small-for-gestational-age births. ACOG currently supports the two-step approach but notes that one elevated value, as opposed to two, may be used for the diagnosis of GDM (222). If this approach is implemented, the incidence of GDM by the two-step strategy will likely increase markedly. ACOG recommends either of two sets of diagnostic thresholds for the 3-h 100-g OGTT Carpenter-Coustan or National Diabetes Data Group (226,227). Each is based on different mathematical conversions of the original recommended thresholds by O’Sullivan and Mahan (207), which used whole blood and nonenzymatic methods for glucose determination. A secondary analysis of data from a randomized clinical trial of identification and treatment of mild GDM (228) demonstrated that treatment was similarly beneficial in people meeting only the lower thresholds per Carpenter-Coustan (226) and in those meeting only the higher thresholds per National Diabetes Data Group (227). If the two-step approach is used, it would appear advantageous to use the Carpenter-Coustan lower diagnostic thresholds, as shown in step 2 in Table 2.7 . \\n \\n Future Considerations \\n \\n The conflicting recommendations from expert groups underscore the fact that there are data to support each strategy. A systematic review of economic evaluations of GDM screening found that the one-step method identified more cases of GDM and was more likely to be cost-effective than the two-step method (229). The decision of which strategy to implement must therefore be made based on the relative values placed on factors that have yet to be measured (e.g., willingness to change practice based on correlation studies rather than intervention trial results, available infrastructure, and importance of cost considerations). \\n The IADPSG criteria (one-step strategy) have been adopted internationally as the preferred approach. Data that compare population-wide outcomes with one-step versus two-step approaches have been inconsistent to date (213,230–232). In addition, pregnancies complicated by GDM per the IADPSG criteria, but not recognized as such, have outcomes comparable to pregnancies with diagnosed GDM by the more stringent two-step criteria (233,234). There remains strong consensus that establishing a uniform approach to diagnosing GDM will benefit people with GDM, caregivers, and policymakers. Longer-term outcome studies are currently underway. \\n \\n Suggested citation: American Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee. 2.

Diabetes can be diagnosed by demonstrating increased concentrations of glucose in venous plasma or increased A1C in the blood. Diabetes is classified conventionally into several clinical categories (e.g., type 1 or type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes mellitus, and other specific types derived from other causes, such as genetic causes, exocrine pancreatic disorders, and medications) (2).\\n\\n Diagnostic Tests for Diabetes\\n\\n Recommendations\\n\\n * 2.1a Diagnose diabetes based on A1C or plasma glucose criteria, either the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) value, 2-h plasma glucose (2-h PG) value during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or random glucose value accompanied by classic hyperglycemic symptoms/crises criteria (Table 2.1 ).

It should be noted that detection rates of different screening tests vary in both populations and individuals. FPG, 2-h PG, and A1C reflect different aspects of glucose metabolism, and diagnostic cut points for the different tests will identify different groups of people (3). Compared with FPG and A1C cut points, the 2-h PG value diagnoses more people with prediabetes and diabetes (4). Moreover, the efficacy of interventions for primary prevention of type 2 diabetes has mainly been demonstrated among individuals who have impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) with or without elevated fasting glucose, not for individuals with isolated impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or for those with prediabetes defined by A1C criteria (5–8).\\n\\n The same tests may be used to screen for and diagnose diabetes and to detect individuals with prediabetes (9) (Table 2.1 and Table 2.2 ). Diabetes may be identified anywhere along the spectrum of clinical scenarios—in seemingly low-risk individuals who happen to have glucose testing, in individuals screened based on diabetes risk assessment, and in symptomatic individuals. There is presently insufficient evidence to support the use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for screening or diagnosis of prediabetes or diabetes. For additional details on the evidence used to establish the criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes, prediabetes, and abnormal glucose tolerance (IFG and IGT), see the American Diabetes Association (ADA) position statement “Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus” (2) and other reports (3,10,11).\\n\\n Table 2.2\\n\\n Criteria defining prediabetes in nonpregnant individuals\\n\\n A1C 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol) \\n OR \\n FPG 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) to 125 mg/dL (6.9 mmol/L) (IFG) \\n OR \\n 2-h PG during 75-g OGTT 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) to 199 mg/dL (11.0 mmol/L) (IGT)\\n \\n A1C 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol) \\n OR \\n FPG 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) to 125 mg/dL (6.9 mmol/L) (IFG) \\n OR \\n 2-h PG during 75-g OGTT 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) to 199 mg/dL (11.0 mmol/L) (IGT)\\n \\n\\n For all three tests, risk is continuous, extending below the lower limit of the range and becoming disproportionately greater at the higher end of the range. FPG, fasting plasma glucose; IFG, impaired fasting glucose; IGT, impaired glucose tolerance; OGTT, oral glucose tolerance test; 2-h PG, 2-h plasma glucose.\\n\\n View Large\\n\\n Use of Fasting Plasma Glucose or 2-Hour Plasma Glucose for Screening and Diagnosis of Diabetes\\n\\n In the less common clinical scenario where a person has classic hyperglycemic symptoms (e.g., polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss), measurement of random plasma glucose is sufficient to diagnose diabetes (symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis plus random plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL [≥11.1 mmol/L]). In these cases, knowing the plasma glucose level is critical because, in addition to confirming that symptoms are due to diabetes, it will inform management decisions. Health care professionals may also want to know the A1C to determine the chronicity of hyperglycemia.\\n\\n In an individual without symptoms, FPG or 2-h PG can be used for screening and diagnosis of diabetes. In nonpregnant individuals, FPG (or A1C) is typically preferred for routine screening due to the ease of administration; however, the 2-h PG (OGTT) testing protocol may identify individuals with diabetes who may otherwise be missed (e.g., those with cystic fibrosis–related diabetes or posttransplantation diabetes mellitus). In the absence of classic hyperglycemic symptoms, repeat testing is required to confirm the diagnosis regardless of the test used (see confirming the diagnosis , below).\\n\\n An advantage of glucose testing is that these assays are inexpensive and widely available. Disadvantages include the high diurnal variation in glucose and fasting requirement. Individuals may have difficulty fasting for the full 8-h period or may misreport their fasting status. Recent physical activity, illness, or acute stress can also affect glucose concentrations. Glycolysis is also an important and underrecognized concern with glucose testing. Glucose concentrations will be falsely low if samples are not processed promptly or stored properly prior to analysis (1).\\n\\n People should consume a mixed diet with at least 150 g of carbohydrates on the 3 days prior to OGTT (12–14). Fasting and carbohydrate restriction can falsely elevate glucose level with an oral glucose challenge.\\n\\n Use of A1C for Screening and Diagnosis of Diabetes\\n\\n Recommendations\\n\\n * 2.2a The A1C test should be performed using a method that is certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) as traceable to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) reference assay. B\\n\\n * 2.2b Point-of-care A1C testing for diabetes screening and diagnosis should be restricted to U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved devices at Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)–certified laboratories that perform testing of moderate complexity or higher by trained personnel. B\\n\\n * 2.3 Marked discordance between A1C and repeat blood glucose values should raise the possibility of a problem or interference with either test. B\\n\\n * 2.4 In conditions associated with an altered relationship between A1C and glycemia, such as some hemoglobin variants, pregnancy (second and third trimesters and the postpartum period), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, HIV, hemodialysis, recent blood loss or transfusion, or erythropoietin therapy, plasma glucose criteria should be used to diagnose diabetes. B\\n\\n The A1C test should be performed using a method that is certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) (ngsp.org) and standardized or traceable to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) reference assay. Point-of-care A1C assays may be NGSP certified and cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in monitoring glycemic control in people with diabetes in both Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)–regulated and CLIA-waived settings. FDA-approved point-of-care A1C testing can be used in laboratories or sites that are CLIA certified, are inspected, and meet the CLIA quality standards. These standards include specified personnel requirements (including documented annual competency assessments) and participation three times per year in an approved proficiency testing program (15–18).\\n\\n A1C has several advantages compared with FPG and OGTT, including greater convenience (fasting not required), greater preanalytical stability, and fewer day-to-day perturbations during stress, changes in nutrition, or illness. However, it should be noted that there is lower sensitivity of A1C at the designated cut point compared with that of glucose tests as well as greater cost and limited access in some parts of the world.\\n\\n A1C reflects glucose bound to hemoglobin over the life span of the erythrocyte (∼120 days) and is thus a “weighted” average that is more heavily affected by recent blood glucose exposure. This means that clinically meaningful changes in A1C can be seen in <120 days. A1C is an indirect measure of glucose exposure, and factors that affect hemoglobin concentrations or erythrocyte turnover can affect A1C (e.g., thalassemia or folate deficiency). A1C may not be a suitable diagnostic test in people with anemia, people treated with erythropoietin, or people undergoing hemodialysis or HIV treatment (19,20). Some hemoglobin variants can interfere with A1C test results, but this depends on the specific assay. For individuals with a hemoglobin variant but normal red blood cell turnover, such as those with the sickle cell trait, an A1C assay without interference from hemoglobin variants should be used. An updated list of A1C assays with interferences is available at ngsp.org/interf.asp. Another genetic variant, X-linked glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase G202A, carried by 11% of African American individuals in the U.S., is associated with a decrease in A1C of about 0.8% in homozygous men and 0.7% in homozygous women compared with levels in individuals without the variant (21).\\n\\n There is controversy regarding racial differences in A1C. Studies have found that African American individuals have slightly higher A1C levels than non-Hispanic White or Hispanic people (22–25). The glucose-independent racial difference in A1C is small (∼0.3 percentage points) and may reflect genetic differences in hemoglobin or red cell turnover that vary by ancestry. There is an emerging understanding of the genetic determinants of A1C (21), but the field lacks adequate genetic data in diverse populations (26,27). While some genetic variants might be more common in certain race or ancestry groups, it is important that we do not use race or ancestry as proxies for poorly understood genetic differences. Reassuringly, studies have shown that the association of A1C with risk for complications appears to be similar in African American and non-Hispanic White populations (28).\\n\\n Confirming the Diagnosis\\n\\n Unless there is a clear clinical diagnosis (e.g., individual with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis and random plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL [≥11.1 mmol/L]), diagnosis requires two abnormal screening test results, measured either at the same time (29) or at two different time points. If using samples at two different time points, it is recommended that the second test, which may be either a repeat of the initial test or a different test, be performed promptly. For example, if the A1C is 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) and a repeat result is 6.8% (51 mmol/mol), the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed. Two different tests (such as A1C and FPG) both having results above the diagnostic threshold when collected at the same time or at two different time points would also confirm the diagnosis. On the other hand, if an individual has discordant results from two different tests, then the test result that is above the diagnostic cut point should be repeated, with careful consideration of factors that may affect measured A1C or glucose levels. The diagnosis is made based on the confirmatory screening test. For example, if an individual meets the diabetes criterion of A1C (two results ≥6.5% [≥48 mmol/mol]) but not FPG (<126 mg/dL [<7.0 mmol/L]), that person should nevertheless be considered to have diabetes.\\n\\n If individuals have test results near the margins of the diagnostic threshold, the health care professional should educate the individual about the onset of possible hyperglycemic symptoms and repeat the test in 3–6 months.\\n\\n Consistent and substantial discordance between glucose and A1C test results should prompt additional follow-up to determine the underlying reason for the discrepancy and whether it has clinical implications for the individual. In addition, consider other biomarkers, such as fructosamine and glycated albumin, which are alternative measures of chronic hyperglycemia that are approved for clinical use for monitoring glycemic control in people with diabetes.\\n\\n Classification\\n\\n Recommendation\\n\\n * 2.5 Classify people with hyperglycemia into appropriate diagnostic categories to aid in personalized management. E\\n\\n Diabetes is classified conventionally into several clinical categories, although these are being reconsidered based on genetic, metabolomic, and other characteristics and pathophysiology (2):\\n\\n 1. Type 1 diabetes (due to autoimmune β-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency, including latent autoimmune diabetes in adults)\\n\\n 2. Type 2 diabetes (due to a non-autoimmune progressive loss of adequate β-cell insulin secretion, frequently on the background of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome)\\n\\n 3. Specific types of diabetes due to other causes, e.g., monogenic diabetes syndromes (such as neonatal diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of the young), diseases of the exocrine pancreas (such as cystic fibrosis and pancreatitis), and drug- or chemical-induced diabetes (such as with glucocorticoid use, in the treatment of people with HIV, or after organ transplantation)\\n\\n 4. Gestational diabetes mellitus (diabetes diagnosed in the second or third trimester of pregnancy that was not clearly overt diabetes prior to gestation or other types of diabetes occurring throughout pregnancy, such as type 1 diabetes).\\n\\n This section reviews most common forms of diabetes but is not comprehensive. For additional information, see the ADA position statement “Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus” (2).\\n\\n Type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are heterogeneous diseases in which clinical presentation and disease progression may vary considerably. Classification is important for determining personalized therapy, but some individuals cannot be clearly classified as having type 1 or type 2 diabetes at the time of diagnosis. The traditional paradigms of type 2 diabetes occurring only in adults and type 1 diabetes only in children are not accurate, as both diseases occur in all age-groups. Children with type 1 diabetes often present with the hallmark symptoms of polyuria/polydipsia, and approximately half present with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) (30–32). The onset of type 1 diabetes may be more variable in adults; they may not present with the classic symptoms seen in children and may experience temporary remission from the need for anticipated full-dose insulin replacement (33–35). The features most useful in discrimination of type 1 diabetes include younger age at diagnosis (<35 years) with lower BMI (<25 kg/m2), unintentional weight loss, ketoacidosis, and plasma glucose >360 mg/dL (>20 mmol/L) at presentation (36) (Fig. 2.1 ). Other features classically associated with type 1 diabetes, such as ketosis without acidosis, osmotic symptoms, family history, or a history of autoimmune diseases, are weak discriminators. Occasionally, people with type 2 diabetes may present with DKA (37,38), particularly members of certain racial and ethnic groups (e.g., African American adults, who may present with ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes) (39).\\n\\n Figure 2.1\\n View largeDownload slide\\n\\n Flowchart for investigation of suspected type 1 diabetes in newly diagnosed adults, based on data from White European populations. 1No single clinical feature confirms type 1 diabetes in isolation. 2Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) should be the primary antibody measured and, if negative, should be followed by islet tyrosine phosphatase 2 (IA-2) and/or zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8) where these tests are available. In individuals who have not been treated with insulin, antibodies against insulin may also be useful. In those diagnosed at <35 years of age who have no clinical features of type 2 diabetes or monogenic diabetes, a negative result does not change the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, since 5–10% of people with type 1 diabetes do not have antibodies. 3Monogenic diabetes is suggested by the presence of one or more of the following features: A1C <58 mmol/mol (<7.5%) at diagnosis, one parent with diabetes, features of a specific monogenic cause (e.g., renal cysts, partial lipodystrophy, maternally inherited deafness, and severe insulin resistance in the absence of obesity), and monogenic diabetes prediction model probability >5% (diabetesgenes.org/exeter-diabetes-app/ModyCalculator). 4A C-peptide test is only indicated in people receiving insulin treatment. A random sample (with concurrent glucose) within 5 h of eating can replace a formal C-peptide stimulation test in the context of classification. If the result is ≥600 pmol/L (≥1.8 ng/mL), the circumstances of testing do not matter. If the result is <600 pmol/L (<1.8 ng/mL) and the concurrent glucose is <4 mmol/L (<70 mg/dL) or the person may have been fasting, consider repeating the test. Results showing very low levels (e.g., <80 pmol/L [<0.24 ng/mL]) do not need to be repeated. Where a person is insulin treated, C-peptide must be measured prior to insulin discontinuation to exclude severe insulin deficiency. Do not test C-peptide within 2 weeks of a hyperglycemic emergency. 5Features of type 2 diabetes include increased BMI (≥25 kg/m2), absence of weight loss, absence of ketoacidosis, and less marked hyperglycemia. Less discriminatory features include non-White ethnicity, family history, longer duration and milder severity of symptoms prior to presentation, features of the metabolic syndrome, and absence of a family history of autoimmunity. 6If genetic testing does not confirm monogenic diabetes, the classification is unclear and a clinical decision should be made about treatment. 7Type 2 diabetes should be strongly considered in older individuals. In some cases, investigation for pancreatic or other types of diabetes may be appropriate. 8A person with possible type 1 diabetes who is not treated with insulin will require careful monitoring and education so that insulin can be rapidly initiated in the event of glycemic deterioration. 9C-peptide values 200–600 pmol/L (0.6–1.8 ng/mL) are usually consistent with type 1 diabetes or maturity-onset diabetes of the young but may occur in insulin-treated type 2 diabetes, particularly in people with normal or low BMI or after long duration.

Reprinted and adapted from Holt et al. (36).\\n\\n Close modal\\n\\n It is important for health care professionals to realize that classification of diabetes type is not always straightforward at presentation and that misdiagnosis is common and can occur in ∼40% of adults with new type 1 diabetes (e.g., adults with type 1 diabetes misdiagnosed as having type 2 diabetes and individuals with maturity-onset diabetes of the young [MODY] misdiagnosed as having type 1 diabetes) (36). Although difficulties in distinguishing diabetes type may occur in all age-groups at onset, the diagnosis becomes more obvious over time in people with β-cell deficiency as the degree of β-cell deficiency becomes clear (Fig. 2.1 ). One useful clinical tool for distinguishing diabetes type is the AABBCC approach: Age (e.g., for individuals <35 years old, consider type 1 diabetes); Autoimmunity (e.g., personal or family history of autoimmune disease or polyglandular autoimmune syndromes); Body habitus (e.g., BMI <25 kg/m2); Background (e.g., family history of type 1 diabetes); Control (e.g., level of glucose control on noninsulin therapies); and Comorbidities (e.g., treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors for cancer can cause acute autoimmune type 1 diabetes) (36).\\n\\n In both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, genetic and environmental factors can result in the progressive loss of β-cell mass and/or function that manifests clinically as hyperglycemia. Once hyperglycemia occurs, people with all forms of diabetes are at risk for developing the same chronic complications, although rates of progression may differ. The identification of individualized therapies for diabetes in the future will be informed by better characterization of the many paths to β-cell demise or dysfunction (40). Across the globe, many groups are working on combining clinical, pathophysiological, and genetic characteristics to more precisely define the subsets of diabetes that are currently clustered into the type 1 diabetes versus type 2 diabetes nomenclature with the goal of optimizing personalized treatment approaches (41).\\n\\n Characterization of the underlying pathophysiology is more precisely developed in type 1 diabetes than in type 2 diabetes. It is clear from prospective studies that the persistent presence of two or more islet autoantibodies is a near-certain predictor of clinical diabetes (42). In at-risk cohorts followed from birth or a very young age, seroconversion rarely occurs before 6 months of age and there is a peak in seroconversion between 9 and 24 months of age (43–45). The rate of progression is dependent on the age at first detection of autoantibody, number of autoantibodies, autoantibody specificity, and autoantibody titer. Glucose and A1C levels may rise well before the clinical onset of diabetes (e.g., changes in FPG and 2-h PG can occur about 6 months before diagnosis) (46), making diagnosis feasible well before the onset of DKA. Three distinct stages of type 1 diabetes have been defined (Table 2.3 ) and serve as a framework for research and regulatory decision-making (40,47).\\n\\n Table 2.3\\n\\n Staging of type 1 diabetes\\n\\n Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 \\n Characteristics • Autoimmunity • Autoimmunity • Autoimmunity \\n • Normoglycemia • Dysglycemia • Overt hyperglycemia \\n • Presymptomatic • Presymptomatic • Symptomatic \\n • Islet autoantibodies (usually multiple) \\n • Multiple islet autoantibodies • Dysglycemia: IFG and/or IGT • Autoantibodies may become absent\\n Diagnostic criteria • No IGT or IFG • FPG 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L) • Diabetes by standard criteria \\n • 2-h PG 140–199 mg/dL (7.8–11.0 mmol/L) \\n • A1C 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol) or ≥10% increase in A1C \\n \\n Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 \\n Characteristics • Autoimmunity • Autoimmunity • Autoimmunity \\n • Normoglycemia • Dysglycemia • Overt hyperglycemia \\n • Presymptomatic • Presymptomatic • Symptomatic \\n • Islet autoantibodies (usually multiple) \\n • Multiple islet autoantibodies • Dysglycemia: IFG and/or IGT • Autoantibodies may become absent\\n Diagnostic criteria • No IGT or IFG • FPG 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L) • Diabetes by standard criteria \\n • 2-h PG 140–199 mg/dL (7.8–11.0 mmol/L) \\n • A1C 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol) or ≥10% increase in A1C \\n \\n\\n Adapted from Skyler et al.

Alternative additional stage 2 diagnostic criteria of 30-, 60-, or 90-min plasma glucose on oral glucose tolerance test ≥200 mg/dL (≥11.1 mmol/L) and confirmatory testing in those aged ≥18 years have been used in clinical trials (79).\\n\\n View Large\\n\\n There is debate as to whether slowly progressive autoimmune diabetes with an adult onset should be termed latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) or type 1 diabetes. The clinical priority with detection of LADA is awareness that slow autoimmune β-cell destruction can occur in adults, leading to a long duration of marginal insulin secretory capacity. For this classification, all forms of diabetes mediated by autoimmune β-cell destruction independent of age of onset are included under the rubric of type 1 diabetes. Use of the term LADA is common and acceptable in clinical practice and has the practical impact of heightening awareness of a population of adults likely to have progressive autoimmune β-cell destruction (48), thus accelerating insulin initiation prior to deterioration of glucose management or development of DKA (34,49). At the same time, there is evidence that application of only a single imperfect autoantibody test for determining LADA classification may lead to misclassification of some individuals with type 2 diabetes. Diagnostic accuracy may be improved by utilizing higher-specificity tests, confirmatory testing for other autoantibodies, and restricting testing to those with clinical features suggestive of autoimmune diabetes (50).\\n\\n The paths to β-cell demise and dysfunction are less well defined in type 2 diabetes, but deficient β-cell insulin secretion, frequently in the setting of insulin resistance, appears to be the common denominator. Type 2 diabetes is associated with insulin secretory defects related to genetic predisposition, epigenetic changes, inflammation, and metabolic stress. Future classification schemes for diabetes will likely focus on the pathophysiology of the underlying β-cell dysfunction (40,51–54).\\n\\n Type 1 Diabetes\\n\\n Recommendations\\n\\n * 2.6 Screening for presymptomatic type 1 diabetes may be done by detection of autoantibodies to insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), islet antigen 2 (IA-2), or zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8). B\\n\\n * 2.7 Having multiple confirmed islet autoantibodies is a risk factor for clinical diabetes. Testing for dysglycemia may be used to further forecast near-term risk. When multiple islet autoantibodies are identified, referral to a specialized center for further evaluation and/or consideration of a clinical trial or approved therapy to potentially delay development of clinical diabetes should be considered. B\\n\\n * 2.8 Standardized islet autoantibody tests are recommended for classification of diabetes in adults who have phenotypic risk factors that overlap with those for type 1 diabetes (e.g., younger age at diagnosis, unintentional weight loss, ketoacidosis, or short time to insulin treatment). E\\n\\n Immune-Mediated Diabetes\\n\\n Autoimmune type 1 diabetes accounts for 5–10% of diabetes and is caused by autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic β-cells. Autoimmune markers include islet cell autoantibodies and autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) (such as GAD65), insulin, the tyrosine phosphatases islet antigen 2 (IA-2) and IA-2β, and zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8). Numerous clinical studies are being conducted to test various methods of preventing or delaying type 1 diabetes in those with evidence of islet autoimmunity (trialnet.org/our-research/prevention-studies) (42–44,49,55,56). The disease has strong HLA associations, with linkage to the DQB1 and DRB1 haplotypes, and genetic screening has been used in some research studies to identify high-risk populations. Specific alleles in these genes can be either predisposing (e.g., DRB1*0301-DQB1*0201 [DR3-DQ2] and DRB1*0401-DQB1*0302 [DR4-DQ8]) or protective (e.g., DRB1*1501 and DQA1*0102-DQB1*0602). Stage 1 of type 1 diabetes is defined by the presence of two or more of these autoantibodies and normoglycemia. At stage 1, the 5-year risk of developing symptomatic type 1 diabetes is ∼44% overall but varies considerably based on number, titer, and specificity of autoantibodies as well as age of seroconversion and genetic risk (47). Stage 2 includes individuals with multiple islet autoantibodies and dysglycemia. At stage 2 of the disease, there is ∼60% risk by 2 years and ∼75% risk within 5 years of developing symptomatic type 1 diabetes (57,58).\\n\\n The rate of β-cell destruction is quite variable, being rapid in some individuals (particularly but not exclusively in infants and children) and slow in others (mainly but not exclusively adults) (46,59). Children and adolescents often present with DKA as the first manifestation of the disease, and rates in the U.S. have increased dramatically over the past 20 years (30–32). Others have modest fasting hyperglycemia that can rapidly change to severe hyperglycemia and/or DKA with infection or other stress. Adults may retain sufficient β-cell function to prevent DKA for many years; such individuals may have remission or decreased insulin needs for months or years, eventually become dependent on insulin for survival, and are at risk for DKA (33–35,60,61). At this later stage of the disease, there is little or no insulin secretion, as manifested by low or undetectable levels of plasma C-peptide. Immune-mediated diabetes is the most common form of diabetes in childhood and adolescence, but it can occur at any age.\\n\\n Autoimmune destruction of β-cells has multiple genetic factors and is also related to environmental factors that are still poorly defined. Although individuals do not typically have obesity when they present with type 1 diabetes, obesity is increasingly common in the general population; as such, obesity should not preclude testing for type 1 diabetes. People with type 1 diabetes are also prone to other autoimmune disorders, such as Hashimoto thyroiditis, Graves disease, celiac disease, Addison disease, vitiligo, autoimmune hepatitis, myasthenia gravis, and pernicious anemia (see Section 4, “Comprehensive Medical Evaluation and Assessment of Comorbidities”). Type 1 diabetes can be associated with monogenic polyglandular autoimmune syndromes, including immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, and X-linked (IPEX) syndrome, which is an early-onset systemic autoimmune, genetic disorder caused by mutation of the forkhead box protein 3 (FOXP3) gene, and another disorder caused by the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene mutation (62,63).\\n\\n Introduction of immunotherapy, specifically checkpoint inhibitors, for cancer treatment has led to unexpected adverse events, including immune system activation precipitating autoimmune disease. Fulminant onset of type 1 diabetes can occur, with DKA and low or undetectable levels of C-peptide as a marker of endogenous β-cell function (64–66). Fewer than half of these individuals have autoantibodies that are seen in type 1 diabetes, supporting alternate pathobiology. This immune-related adverse event occurs in just under 1% of checkpoint inhibitor–treated individuals but most commonly occurs with agents that block the programmed cell death protein 1/programmed cell death ligand 1 pathway alone or in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors (67). To date, the majority of immune checkpoint inhibitor–related cases of type 1 diabetes occur in people with high-risk HLA-DR4 (present in 76% of individuals), whereas other high-risk HLA alleles are not more common than those in the general population (67). To date, risk cannot be predicted by family history or autoantibodies, so all health care professionals administering these medications or caring for people who have a history of current or past exposure to these agents should be mindful of this adverse effect and educate and monitor individuals appropriately.\\n\\n A number of viruses have been associated with type 1 diabetes, including enteroviruses such as Coxsackievirus B. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, cases of hyperglycemia, DKA, and new diabetes increased, suggesting that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a trigger for or can unmask type 1 diabetes (68). Possible mechanisms of β-cell damage include virus-triggered β-cell death, immune-mediated loss of pancreatic β-cells, and damage to β-cells because of infection of surrounding exocrine cells. The cytokine storm associated with COVID-19 infection is a highly inflammatory state that could also contribute. To better characterize and understand the pathogenesis of new-onset COVID-19–related diabetes, a global registry, CoviDIAB, has been established (69).\\n\\n Idiopathic Type 1 Diabetes\\n\\n Some forms of type 1 diabetes have no known etiologies. Individuals have permanent insulinopenia and are prone to DKA but have no evidence of β-cell autoimmunity. However, only a minority of people with type 1 diabetes fall into this category.\\n\\n Individuals with autoantibody-negative diabetes of African or Asian ancestry may suffer from episodic DKA and exhibit varying degrees of insulin deficiency between episodes (70). This form of diabetes is usually considered a form of type 2 diabetes (ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes), is strongly inherited, and is not HLA associated. An absolute requirement for insulin replacement therapy in affected individuals may be intermittent. Future research is needed to determine the cause of β-cell dysfunction/destruction in this rare clinical scenario.\\n\\n Screening for Type 1 Diabetes Risk\\n\\n The incidence and prevalence of type 1 diabetes are increasing (71). People with type 1 diabetes often present with acute symptoms of diabetes and markedly elevated blood glucose levels, and 25–50% are diagnosed with life-threatening DKA (30–32). Multiple studies indicate that measuring islet autoantibodies in relatives of those with type 1 diabetes (47) or in children from the general population (72,73) can effectively identify those who will develop type 1 diabetes. A study reported the risk of progression to type 1 diabetes from the time of seroconversion to autoantibody positivity in three pediatric cohorts from Finland, Germany, and the U.S. Of the 585 children who developed more than two autoantibodies, nearly 70% developed type 1 diabetes within 10 years and 84% within 15 years (42). These findings are highly significant, because while the German group was recruited from offspring of parents with type 1 diabetes, the Finnish and American groups were recruited from the general population. Remarkably, the findings in all three groups were the same, suggesting that the same sequence of events led to clinical disease in both “sporadic” and familial cases of type 1 diabetes. Indeed, the risk of type 1 diabetes increases as the number of relevant autoantibodies detected increases (55,74,75). In The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study, type 1 diabetes developed in 21% of 363 subjects with at least one autoantibody at 3 years of age (76). Such testing, coupled with education about diabetes symptoms and close follow-up, has been shown to enable earlier diagnosis and to prevent DKA (77,78).\\n\\n Several screening programs are available in Europe (e.g., Fr1da and gppad.org) and the U.S. (e.g., trialnet.org, askhealth.org, and cascadekids.org). Family history of autoimmune diabetes and personal or family history of allergic diseases or other autoimmune diseases increases the risk of autoimmune diabetes compared with the general population (78,79). Individuals who test autoantibody positive should be provided with or referred for counseling about the risk of developing diabetes, diabetes symptoms, and DKA prevention and should be given consideration for additional testing as applicable to help determine if they meet criteria for intervention aimed at delaying progression.\\n\\n Prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes\\n\\n Recommendations\\n\\n * 2.9 Screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes with an assessment of risk factors or validated risk calculator should be done in asymptomatic adults. B\\n\\n * 2.10a Testing for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic people should be considered in adults of any age with overweight or obesity who have one or more risk factors (Table 2.4 ). B\\n\\n * 2.10b For all other people, screening should begin at age 35 years. B\\n\\n * 2.11 If tests are normal, repeat screening recommended at a minimum of 3-year intervals is reasonable, sooner with symptoms or change in risk (e.g., weight gain). C\\n\\n * 2.12 To screen for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, FPG, 2-h PG during 75-g OGTT, and A1C are each appropriate (Table 2.1 and Table 2.2 ). B\\n\\n * 2.13 When using OGTT as a screen for prediabetes or diabetes, adequate carbohydrate intake (at least 150 g/day) should be assured for 3 days prior to testing. A\\n\\n * 2.14 Risk-based screening for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes should be considered after the onset of puberty or after 10 years of age, whichever occurs earlier, in children and adolescents with overweight (BMI ≥85th percentile) or obesity (BMI ≥95th percentile) and who have one or more risk factors for diabetes. (See Table 2.5 for evidence grading of risk factors.) B\\n\\n * 2.15a Consider screening people for prediabetes or diabetes if on certain medications, such as glucocorticoids, statins, thiazide diuretics, some HIV medications, and second-generation antipsychotic medications, as these agents are known to increase the risk of these conditions. E\\n\\n * 2.15b In people who are prescribed second-generation antipsychotic medications, screen for prediabetes and diabetes at baseline and repeat 12–16 weeks after medication initiation or sooner, if clinically indicated, and annually. B\\n\\n * 2.16 People with HIV should be screened for diabetes and prediabetes with an FPG test before starting antiretroviral therapy, at the time of switching antiretroviral therapy, and 3–6 months after starting or switching antiretroviral therapy.

If tests are normal, repeat testing at a minimum of 3-year intervals (or more frequently if BMI is increasing or risk factor profile is deteriorating) is recommended. Reports of type 2 diabetes before age 10 years exist, and this can be considered with numerous risk factors.\\n\\n View Large\\n\\n Prediabetes\\n\\n Prediabetes is the term used for individuals whose glucose or A1C levels do not meet the criteria for diabetes yet have abnormal carbohydrate metabolism that results in elevated glucose levels (dysglycemia) intermediate between normoglycemia and diabetes (28,80). People with prediabetes are defined by the presence of IFG and/or IGT and/or A1C 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol) (Table 2.2 ). As prediabetes is an intermediate state between normoglycemia and diabetes, it is clearly a significant risk factor for progression to diabetes as well as cardiovascular disease and several other cardiometabolic outcomes. Criteria for screening for diabetes or prediabetes in asymptomatic adults are outlined in Table 2.4 . Prediabetes is associated with obesity (especially abdominal or visceral obesity), dyslipidemia with high triglycerides and/or low HDL cholesterol, and hypertension. The presence of prediabetes should prompt comprehensive screening for cardiovascular risk factors.\\n\\n Diagnosis of Prediabetes\\n\\n IFG is defined as FPG levels from 100 to 125 mg/dL (from 5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) (78,79) and IGT as 2-h PG levels during 75-g OGTT from 140 to 199 mg/dL (from 7.8 to 11.0 mmol/L) (10). It should be noted that the World Health Organization and a number of diabetes organizations define the IFG lower limit at 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L). The ADA also initially endorsed this IFG lower limit in 1997 (10). However, in 2003 the ADA adopted the new range of 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L) to better define IFG so that the population risk of developing diabetes with IFG would be similar to that with IGT (11).\\n\\n As with the glucose measures, several prospective studies that used A1C to predict the progression to diabetes as defined by A1C criteria demonstrated a strong, continuous association between A1C and subsequent diabetes. In a systematic review of 44,203 individuals from 16 cohort studies with a follow-up interval averaging 5.6 years (range 2.8–12 years), those with A1C between 5.5% and 6.0% (between 37 and 42 mmol/mol) had a substantially increased risk of diabetes (5-year incidence from 9% to 25%). Those with an A1C range of 6.0–6.5% (42–48 mmol/mol) had a 5-year risk of developing diabetes between 25% and 50% and a relative risk 20 times higher than that with A1C of 5.0% (31 mmol/mol) (81). In a community-based study of African American and non-Hispanic White adults without diabetes, baseline A1C was a stronger predictor of subsequent diabetes and cardiovascular events than fasting glucose (82). Other analyses suggest that A1C of 5.7% (39 mmol/mol) or higher is associated with a diabetes risk similar to that of the high-risk participants in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) (83), and A1C at baseline was a strong predictor of the development of glucose-defined diabetes during the DPP and its follow-up (7).\\n\\n An A1C range of 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol) identifies a group of individuals at high risk for diabetes and cardiovascular outcomes. Similar to those with IFG and/or IGT, individuals with A1C of 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol) should be informed of their increased risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease and counseled about effective strategies to lower their risks (see Section 3, “Prevention or Delay of Diabetes and Associated Comorbidities”). Similar to glucose measurements, the continuum of risk is continuous: as A1C rises, the diabetes risk rises disproportionately (81). Aggressive interventions and vigilant follow-up should be pursued for those considered at very high risk (e.g., those with A1C >6.0% [>42 mmol/mol] and individuals with both IFG and IGT).\\n\\n Table 2.4 outlines the criteria for screening for prediabetes. The ADA risk test is an additional option for assessment to determine the appropriateness of screening for diabetes or prediabetes in asymptomatic adults (Fig. 2.2 ) (online at diabetes.org/socrisktest). For additional background regarding risk factors and screening for prediabetes, see screening and testing for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic adults and screening and testing for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents , below.

This form encompasses individuals who generally have relative (rather than absolute) insulin deficiency and have peripheral insulin resistance (i.e., decreased biological response to insulin).\\n\\n There are various causes of type 2 diabetes. Although the specific etiologies are not known, autoimmune destruction of β-cells does not occur, and individuals do not have any of the other known causes of diabetes. Most, but not all, people with type 2 diabetes have overweight or obesity. Excess weight itself causes some degree of insulin resistance. Individuals who do not have obesity or overweight by traditional weight criteria may have an increased percentage of body fat distributed predominantly in the abdominal region, including sites involved in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (also known as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease) and/or ectopic sites (e.g., skeletal muscle).\\n\\n DKA seldom occurs spontaneously in type 2 diabetes; when seen, it usually arises in individuals already treated with insulin (e.g., missed or inadequate doses), in people with ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes, in association with the stress of another illness such as infection (e.g., COVID-19) or myocardial infarction, or in association with illicit drug use (e.g., cocaine) or with the use of certain medications such as glucocorticoids, second-generation antipsychotics, or sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (84,85). Type 2 diabetes frequently goes undiagnosed for many years, because hyperglycemia develops gradually and, at earlier stages, is often not severe enough for the individual to notice the classic diabetes symptoms caused by hyperglycemia, such as dehydration or unintentional weight loss. Nevertheless, even undiagnosed people with diabetes are at increased risk of developing macrovascular and microvascular complications.\\n\\n People with type 2 diabetes early in the disease course may have insulin levels that appear normal or elevated, yet the failure to normalize blood glucose reflects a relative defect in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion that is insufficient to compensate for insulin resistance. Insulin resistance may improve with weight reduction, physical activity, and/or pharmacologic treatment of hyperglycemia but is seldom restored to normal. Recent interventions with intensive diet and exercise, newer pharmacological agents (e.g., glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists), or surgical weight loss have led to diabetes remission (86–92) (see Section 8, “Obesity and Weight Management for the Prevention and Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes”).\\n\\n The risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases with age, obesity, and lack of physical activity (93,94). It occurs more frequently in individuals with prediabetes, prior gestational diabetes mellitus, or polycystic ovary syndrome. It is also more common in people with hypertension or dyslipidemia and in certain racial and ethnic subgroups (e.g., African American, Native American, Hispanic/Latino, and Asian American). It is often associated with a strong genetic predisposition or family history in first-degree relatives (more so than type 1 diabetes). However, the genetics of type 2 diabetes are poorly understood and under intense investigation in this era of precision medicine (52). In adults without traditional risk factors for type 2 diabetes and/or of younger age, consider islet autoantibody testing (e.g., GAD autoantibodies) to exclude the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (36) (Fig. 2.1 ).\\n\\n Screening and Testing for Prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes in Asymptomatic Adults\\n\\n Screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes risk through a targeted assessment of risk factors (Table 2.4 ) or with an assessment tool, such as the ADA risk test (Fig. 2.2 ) (online at diabetes.org/socrisktest), is recommended to guide health care professionals on whether performing a diagnostic test (Table 2.1 ) is appropriate. Prediabetes and type 2 diabetes meet criteria for conditions in which early detection via screening is appropriate. Both conditions are common and impose significant clinical and public health burdens. There is often a long presymptomatic phase before the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Simple tests to detect preclinical disease are readily available (95). The duration of glycemic burden is a strong predictor of adverse outcomes. There are effective interventions that prevent progression from prediabetes to diabetes. It is important to individualize risk-to-benefit ratio of formal intervention for people with prediabetes and consider person-centered goals. Risk models have explored the benefit, in general finding higher benefit of intervention in those at highest risk (96) (see Section 3, “Prevention or Delay of Diabetes and Associated Comorbidities”) and reduce the risk of diabetes complications (97) (see Section 10, “Cardiovascular Disease and Risk Management,” Section 11, “Chronic Kidney Disease and Risk Management,” and Section 12, “Retinopathy, Neuropathy, and Foot Care”). In the most recent National Institutes of Health (NIH) Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) report, prevention of progression from prediabetes to diabetes (98) resulted in lower rates of developing retinopathy and nephropathy (99). Similar impact on diabetes complications was reported with screening, diagnosis, and comprehensive risk factor management in the U.K. Clinical Practice Research Datalink database (97). In that report, progression from prediabetes to diabetes augmented risk of complications.\\n\\n Despite the numerous benefits of screening and early diagnosis for prediabetes or diabetes, unfortunately many people in the U.S. and globally either remain undiagnosed or are diagnosed late, when complications have already arisen.\\n\\n Additional considerations regarding testing for type 2 diabetes and prediabetes in asymptomatic individuals are described below.\\n\\n Age\\n\\n Age is a major risk factor for diabetes. Testing should begin at no later than age 35 years for all people (100). Screening should be considered in adults of any age with overweight or obesity and one or more risk factors for diabetes.\\n\\n Medications\\n\\n Certain medications, such as glucocorticoids, statins (101), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, some HIV medications (19), and second-generation antipsychotic medications (102), should be considered when deciding whether to screen for prediabetes or diabetes, as these medications are known to increase the risks of these conditions.\\n\\n For example, people taking second-generation antipsychotic medications, such as olanzapine, require greater monitoring because of an increase in risk of type 2 diabetes associated with this medication (102). There is a range of effects on metabolic parameters (e.g., glucose concentration, hyperglycemia, and weight gain) across second-generation antipsychotic medications; aripiprazole and ziprasidone tend to have fewer metabolic effects, and haloperidol, clozapine, quetiapine, and risperidone tend to have more metabolic effects. People treated with these agents should be screened for prediabetes or diabetes at baseline, rescreened 12–16 weeks after medication initiation, and screened annually thereafter (102).\\n\\n People With HIV\\n\\n People with HIV are at higher risk for developing prediabetes and diabetes on antiretroviral (ARV) therapies; a screening protocol is therefore recommended (103). The A1C test may underestimate glycemia in people with HIV; it is not recommended for diagnosis and may present challenges for monitoring (20). In those with prediabetes, weight loss through healthy nutrition and physical activity may reduce the progression toward diabetes. Among people with HIV and diabetes, preventive health care using an approach used in people without HIV is critical to reduce the risks of microvascular and macrovascular complications. Diabetes risk is increased with certain protease inhibitors (PIs) and nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). New-onset diabetes is estimated to occur in more than 5% of individuals infected with HIV on PIs, whereas more than 15% may have prediabetes (104).\\n\\n PIs are associated with insulin resistance and may also lead to apoptosis of pancreatic β-cells. NRTIs also affect fat distribution (both lipohypertrophy and lipoatrophy), which is associated with insulin resistance. For people with HIV and ARV-associated hyperglycemia, it may be appropriate to consider discontinuing the problematic ARV agents if safe and effective alternatives are available (105). Before making ARV substitutions, carefully consider the possible effect on HIV virological control and the potential adverse effects of new ARV agents. In some cases, antihyperglycemic agents may still be necessary.\\n\\n Testing Interval\\n\\n The appropriate interval between screening tests is not known (106). The rationale for the 3-year interval is that with this interval, the number of false-positive tests that require confirmatory testing will be reduced, and individuals with false-negative tests will be retested before substantial time elapses and complications develop (106). In especially high-risk individuals, particularly with weight gain, shorter intervals between screenings may be useful.\\n\\n Community Screening\\n\\n Ideally, screening should be carried out within a health care setting because of the need for follow-up and treatment. Community screening outside a health care setting is generally not recommended because people with positive tests may not seek, or have access to, appropriate follow-up testing and care. However, in specific situations where an adequate referral system is established beforehand for positive tests, community screening may be considered. Community screening may also be poorly targeted; i.e., it may fail to reach the groups most at risk and inappropriately test those at very low risk or even those who have already been diagnosed (107).\\n\\n Screening in Dental Practices\\n\\n Because periodontal disease is associated with diabetes, the utility of screening in a dental setting and referral to primary care as a means to improve the diagnosis of prediabetes and diabetes has been explored (108–110), with one study estimating that 30% of individuals ≥30 years of age seen in general dental practices (including people with and without periodontal disease) had newly diagnosed dysglycemia (110). A similar study in 1,150 dental patients >40 years old in India reported 20.7% and 14.6% meeting criteria for prediabetes and diabetes, respectively, using random blood glucose (111). Further research is needed to demonstrate the feasibility, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of screening in this setting.\\n\\n Screening and Testing for Prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes in Children and Adolescents\\n\\n The epidemiologic studies that formed the basis for recommending A1C to diagnose diabetes included only adult populations (112). However, recent ADA clinical guidance concluded that A1C, FPG, or 2-h PG could be used to test for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents (113).\\n\\n In the last decade, the incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents has increased dramatically, especially in racial and ethnic minority populations (114). See Table 2.5 for recommendations on risk-based screening for type 2 diabetes or prediabetes in asymptomatic children and adolescents in a clinical setting (113). See Table 2.1 and Table 2.2 for the criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes and prediabetes, respectively, that apply to children, adolescents, and adults. See Section 14, “Children and Adolescents,” for additional information on type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents.\\n\\n Pancreatic Diabetes or Diabetes in the Context of Disease of the Exocrine Pancreas\\n\\n Recommendation\\n\\n * 2.17 Screen people for diabetes within 3–6 months following an episode of acute pancreatitis and annually thereafter. Screening for diabetes is recommended annually for people with chronic pancreatitis. E\\n\\n Pancreatic diabetes (also termed pancreatogenic diabetes or type 3c diabetes) includes both structural and functional loss of glucose-normalizing insulin secretion in the context of exocrine pancreatic dysfunction and is commonly misdiagnosed as type 2 diabetes. The diverse set of etiologies includes pancreatitis (acute and chronic), trauma or pancreatectomy, neoplasia, cystic fibrosis (addressed later in this section), hemochromatosis, fibrocalculous pancreatopathy, rare genetic disorders, and idiopathic forms (2); as such, pancreatic diabetes is the preferred umbrella term (115).\\n\\n Pancreatitis, even a single bout, can lead to postpancreatitis diabetes mellitus. Both acute and chronic pancreatitis can lead to postpancreatitis diabetes mellitus, and the risk is highest with recurrent bouts. A distinguishing feature is concurrent pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (consider screening individuals with acute and chronic pancreatitis for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency by measuring fecal elastase), pathological pancreatic imaging (endoscopic ultrasound, MRI, and computed tomography), and absence of type 1 diabetes–associated autoimmunity (116–120). There is loss of both insulin and glucagon secretion and often higher-than-expected insulin requirements. Risk for microvascular complications appears to be similar to that of other forms of diabetes.\\n\\n For people with pancreatitis and diabetes, therapy should be advanced if A1C goals are not met. Glucose-lowering therapies associated with increased risk of pancreatitis (i.e., incretin-based therapies) should be avoided. Early initiation of insulin therapy should be considered. In the context of pancreatectomy, islet autotransplantation can be considered for selected individuals with medically refractory chronic pancreatitis in specialized centers to preserve endogenous islet function and insulin secretion (121,122). In some cases, autotransplant can lead to insulin independence. In others, it may decrease insulin requirements (123).\\n\\n Cystic Fibrosis–Related Diabetes\\n\\n Recommendations\\n\\n * 2.18 Annual screening for cystic fibrosis–related diabetes (CFRD) with an OGTT should begin by age 10 years in all people with cystic fibrosis not previously diagnosed with CFRD. B\\n\\n * 2.19 A1C is not recommended as a screening test for CFRD due to low sensitivity. However, a value of ≥6.5% (≥48 mmol/mol) is consistent with a diagnosis of CFRD. B\\n\\n * 2.20 Beginning 5 years after the diagnosis of CFRD, annual monitoring for complications of diabetes is recommended. E\\n\\n Cystic fibrosis is a multisystem condition arising from recessive mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. Pancreatic exocrine damage ultimately manifests as pancreatic exocrine insufficiency that begins as early as infancy (124). Cystic fibrosis–related diabetes (CFRD) is the most common comorbidity in people with cystic fibrosis, occurring in about 20% of adolescents and 40–50% of adults (125). The relevance of CFRD is highlighted by its association with increased morbidity, mortality, and patient burden. Diabetes in this population, compared with individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, is associated with worse nutritional status, more severe inflammatory lung disease, and greater mortality. Insulin insufficiency is the primary defect in CFRD. Genetically determined β-cell function and insulin resistance associated with infection and inflammation may also contribute to the development of CFRD. Milder abnormalities of glucose tolerance are even more common and occur at earlier ages than CFRD. Whether individuals with IGT should be treated with insulin replacement has not currently been determined. Although screening for diabetes before the age of 10 years can identify risk for progression to CFRD in those with abnormal glucose tolerance, no benefit has been established with respect to weight, height, BMI, or lung function. OGTT is the recommended screening test for CFRD. Not unexpectedly, annual OGTTs are perceived as burdensome, and adherence to current CFRD screening guidelines is poor, with only 30% of adults with cystic fibrosis having annual OGTTs (126). A1C is not recommended for screening due to low sensitivity; however, a value ≥6.5% (≥48 mmol/mol) is consistent with a diagnosis of CFRD and reduces patient screening burden (127–129). Regardless of age, weight loss or failure of expected weight gain is a risk for CFRD and should prompt screening (127,128). The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry (130) evaluated 3,553 people with cystic fibrosis and diagnosed 445 (13%) with CFRD. Early diagnosis and treatment of CFRD was associated with preservation of lung function. The European Cystic Fibrosis Society Patient Registry reported an increase in CFRD with age (10% increase per decade), genotype, decreased lung function, and female sex (131,132). CGM or HOMA of β-cell function (133) may be more sensitive than OGTT to detect risk for progression to CFRD; however, evidence linking these results to long-term outcomes is lacking, and these tests are not recommended for screening outside the research setting (134).\\n\\n CFRD mortality has significantly decreased over time, and the gap in mortality between people with cystic fibrosis with and without diabetes has considerably narrowed (135). There are limited clinical trial data on therapy for CFRD. People with CFRD should be treated with insulin to attain individualized glycemic goals.\\n\\n Additional resources for the clinical management of CFRD can be found in the position statement “Clinical Care Guidelines for Cystic Fibrosis–Related Diabetes” (136) and in the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes 2018 clinical practice consensus guidelines (125).\\n\\n Posttransplantation Diabetes Mellitus\\n\\n Recommendations\\n\\n * 2.21 After organ transplantation, screening for hyperglycemia should be done. A formal diagnosis of posttransplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is best made once the individual is stable on an immunosuppressive plan and in the absence of an acute infection. B\\n\\n * 2.22 The OGTT is the preferred test to make a diagnosis of PTDM. B\\n\\n * 2.23 Immunosuppressive plans shown to provide the best outcomes for individuals and graft survival should be used, irrespective of PTDM risk. E\\n\\n Several terms are used in the literature to describe the presence of diabetes following organ transplantation (137). New-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) is one such designation that describes individuals who develop new-onset diabetes following transplant. NODAT excludes people with pretransplant diabetes that was undiagnosed as well as posttransplant hyperglycemia that resolves by the time of discharge (138). Another term, posttransplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM) (138,139), describes the presence of diabetes in the posttransplant setting irrespective of the timing of diabetes onset (140). The clinical importance of PTDM lies in its unquestionable impact as a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease in solid-organ transplantation (137).\\n\\n Hyperglycemia is very common during the early posttransplant period, with ∼90% of kidney allograft recipients exhibiting hyperglycemia in the first few weeks following transplant (138,139,141,142). In most cases, such stress- or steroid-induced hyperglycemia resolves by the time of discharge (142,143). Although the use of immunosuppressive therapies is a major contributor to the development of PTDM, the risks of transplant rejection outweigh the risks of PTDM, and the role of the diabetes health care professional is to treat hyperglycemia appropriately regardless of the type of immunosuppression (138). Risk factors for PTDM include both general diabetes risks (such as age, family history of diabetes, obesity, etc.) and transplant-specific factors, such as use of immunosuppressant agents (144–146). Whereas posttransplantation hyperglycemia is an important risk factor for subsequent PTDM, a formal diagnosis of PTDM is optimally made once the individual is stable on maintenance immunosuppression (usually at least 45 days after transplantation) and in the absence of acute infection (138,142–144,147).\\n\\n The OGTT is considered the gold-standard test for the diagnosis of PTDM (1 year posttransplant) (138,139,148,149). Pretransplant elevation in hs-CRP was associated with PTDM in the setting of renal transplant (150,151). However, screening people with FPG and/or A1C can identify high-risk individuals who require further assessment and may reduce the number of overall OGTTs required.\\n\\n Few randomized controlled studies have reported on the short- and long-term use of antihyperglycemic agents in the setting of PTDM (144,152,153). Most studies have reported that transplant patients with hyperglycemia and PTDM after transplantation have higher rates of rejection, infection, and rehospitalization (142,144,154). Insulin therapy is the agent of choice for the management of hyperglycemia, PTDM, preexisting diabetes, and diabetes in the hospital setting and can be continued postdischarge. No studies to date have firmly established which noninsulin agents are safest or most efficacious in PTDM. The choice of agent is usually made based on the side effect profile of the medication, possible interactions with the individual’s immunosuppression plan, and potential cardiovascular and renal benefits in individuals with PTDM (144). Well-designed intervention trials examining the efficacy and safety of these and other antihyperglycemic agents in people with PTDM are needed.\\n\\n Monogenic Diabetes Syndromes\\n\\n Recommendations\\n\\n * 2.24a Regardless of current age, all people diagnosed with diabetes in the first 6 months of life should have immediate genetic testing for neonatal diabetes. A\\n\\n * 2.24b Children and young adults who do not have typical characteristics of type 1 or type 2 diabetes and who often have a family history of diabetes in successive generations (suggestive of an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance) should have genetic testing for maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). A\\n\\n * 2.24c In both instances, consultation with a center specializing in diabetes genetics is recommended to understand the significance of genetic mutations and how best to approach further evaluation, treatment, and genetic counseling. E\\n\\n Monogenic defects that cause β-cell dysfunction, such as neonatal diabetes and MODY, are present in a small fraction of people with diabetes (<5%) (155). Table 2.6 describes the most common causes of monogenic diabetes. For a comprehensive list of causes, see “Genetic Diagnosis of Endocrine Disorders” (156).\\n\\n Table 2.6\\n\\n Most common causes of monogenic diabetes\\n\\n Gene Inheritance Clinical features \\n MODY HNF1A AD HNF1A-MODY: progressive insulin secretory defect with presentation in adolescence or early adulthood; lowered renal threshold for glucosuria; large rise in 2-h PG level on OGTT (>90 mg/dL [>5 mmol/L]); sensitive to sulfonylureas \\n HNF4A AD HNF4A-MODY: progressive insulin secretory defect with presentation in adolescence or early adulthood; may have large birth weight and transient neonatal hypoglycemia; sensitive to sulfonylureas \\n HNF1B AD HNF1B-MODY: developmental renal disease (typically cystic); genitourinary abnormalities; atrophy of the pancreas; hyperuricemia; gout \\n GCK AD GCK-MODY: higher glucose threshold (set point) for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, causing stable, nonprogressive elevated fasting blood glucose; typically does not require treatment; microvascular complications are rare; small rise in 2-h PG level on OGTT (<54 mg/dL [<3 mmol/L])\\n Neonatal diabetes KCNJ11 AD Permanent or transient: IUGR; possible developmental delay and seizures; responsive to sulfonylureas \\n INS AD Permanent: IUGR; insulin requiring \\n ABCC8 AD Permanent or transient: IUGR; rarely developmental delay; responsive to sulfonylureas \\n 6q24 (PLAGL1, HYMA1) AD for paternal duplications Transient: IUGR; macroglossia; umbilical hernia; mechanisms include UPD6, paternal duplication, or maternal methylation defect; may be treatable with medications other than insulin \\n GATA6 AD Permanent: pancreatic hypoplasia; cardiac malformations; pancreatic exocrine insufficiency; insulin requiring \\n EIF2AK3 AR Permanent: Wolcott-Rallison syndrome: epiphyseal dysplasia; pancreatic exocrine insufficiency; insulin requiring \\n EIF2B1 AD Permanent diabetes: can be associated with fluctuating liver function (157) \\n FOXP3 X-linked Permanent: immunodysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy X-linked (IPEX) syndrome: autoimmune diabetes, autoimmune thyroid disease, exfoliative dermatitis; insulin requiring \\n \\n Gene Inheritance Clinical features \\n MODY HNF1A AD HNF1A-MODY: progressive insulin secretory defect with presentation in adolescence or early adulthood; lowered renal threshold for glucosuria; large rise in 2-h PG level on OGTT (>90 mg/dL [>5 mmol/L]); sensitive to sulfonylureas \\n HNF4A AD HNF4A-MODY: progressive insulin secretory defect with presentation in adolescence or early adulthood; may have large birth weight and transient neonatal hypoglycemia; sensitive to sulfonylureas \\n HNF1B AD HNF1B-MODY: developmental renal disease (typically cystic); genitourinary abnormalities; atrophy of the pancreas; hyperuricemia; gout \\n GCK AD GCK-MODY: higher glucose threshold (set point) for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, causing stable, nonprogressive elevated fasting blood glucose; typically does not require treatment; microvascular complications are rare; small rise in 2-h PG level on OGTT (<54 mg/dL [<3 mmol/L])\\n Neonatal diabetes KCNJ11 AD Permanent or transient: IUGR; possible developmental delay and seizures; responsive to sulfonylureas \\n INS AD Permanent: IUGR; insulin requiring \\n ABCC8 AD Permanent or transient: IUGR; rarely developmental delay; responsive to sulfonylureas \\n 6q24 (PLAGL1, HYMA1) AD for paternal duplications Transient: IUGR; macroglossia; umbilical hernia; mechanisms include UPD6, paternal duplication, or maternal methylation defect; may be treatable with medications other than insulin \\n GATA6 AD Permanent: pancreatic hypoplasia; cardiac malformations; pancreatic exocrine insufficiency; insulin requiring \\n EIF2AK3 AR Permanent: Wolcott-Rallison syndrome: epiphyseal dysplasia; pancreatic exocrine insufficiency; insulin requiring \\n EIF2B1 AD Permanent diabetes: can be associated with fluctuating liver function (157) \\n FOXP3 X-linked Permanent: immunodysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy X-linked (IPEX) syndrome: autoimmune diabetes, autoimmune thyroid disease, exfoliative dermatitis; insulin requiring \\n \\n\\n Adapted from Carmody et al.

Neonatal diabetes occurs much less often after 6 months of age, whereas autoimmune type 1 diabetes rarely occurs before 6 months of age. Neonatal diabetes can either be transient or permanent. Transient diabetes is most often due to overexpression of genes on chromosome 6q24, is recurrent in about half of cases, and may be treatable with medications other than insulin. Permanent neonatal diabetes is most commonly due to autosomal dominant mutations in the genes encoding the Kir6.2 subunit (KCNJ11) and SUR1 subunit (ABCC8) of the β-cell KATP channel. A recent report details a de novo mutation in EIF2B1 affecting eIF2 signaling associated with permanent neonatal diabetes and hepatic dysfunction, similar to Wolcott-Rallison syndrome but with few severe comorbidities (161). The recent ADA-European Association for the Study of Diabetes type 1 diabetes consensus report recommends that regardless of current age, individuals diagnosed under 6 months of age should have genetic testing (36). Correct diagnosis has critical implications, because 30–50% of people with KATP-related neonatal diabetes will exhibit improved blood glucose levels when treated with high-dose oral sulfonylureas instead of insulin. Insulin gene (INS) mutations are the second most common cause of permanent neonatal diabetes, and while intensive insulin management is currently the preferred treatment strategy, there are important genetic counseling considerations, as most of the mutations that cause diabetes are dominantly inherited.\\n\\n Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young\\n\\n MODY is frequently characterized by onset of hyperglycemia at an early age (classically before age 25 years, although diagnosis may occur at older ages). MODY is characterized by impaired insulin secretion with minimal or no defects in insulin action (in the absence of coexistent obesity). It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with abnormalities in at least 13 genes on different chromosomes identified to date (162). The most commonly reported forms are GCK-MODY (MODY2), HNF1A-MODY (MODY3), and HNF4A-MODY (MODY1).\\n\\n For individuals with MODY, the treatment implications are considerable and warrant genetic testing (163,164). Clinically, people with GCK-MODY exhibit mild, stable fasting hyperglycemia and do not require antihyperglycemic therapy, although it is commonly needed during pregnancy. Individuals with HNF1A-MODY or HNF4A-MODY usually respond well to low doses of sulfonylureas, which are considered first-line therapy; in some instances, insulin will be required over time. Mutations or deletions in HNF1B are associated with renal cysts and uterine malformations (renal cysts and diabetes [RCAD] syndrome). Other extremely rare forms of MODY have been reported to involve other transcription factor genes, including PDX1 (IPF1) and NEUROD1.\\n\\n Diagnosis of Monogenic Diabetes\\n\\n A diagnosis of one of the three most common forms of MODY, including HNF1A-MODY, GCK-MODY, and HNF4A-MODY, allows for more cost-effective personalized therapy (i.e., no therapy for GCK-MODY and sulfonylureas as first-line therapy for HNF1A-MODY and HNF4A-MODY). Additionally, diagnosis can lead to identification of other affected family members and can indicate potential extrapancreatic complications in affected individuals. Genetic screening (i.e., next-generation sequencing) is increasingly available and cost-effective (161,163).\\n\\n A diagnosis of MODY should be considered in individuals who have atypical diabetes and multiple family members with diabetes not characteristic of type 1 or type 2 diabetes, although admittedly, atypical diabetes is becoming increasingly difficult to precisely define in the absence of a definitive set of tests for either type of diabetes (158–160,163–169) (Fig. 2.1 ). In most cases, the presence of autoantibodies for type 1 diabetes precludes further testing for monogenic diabetes, but the presence of autoantibodies in people with monogenic diabetes has been reported (170). Individuals in whom monogenic diabetes is suspected should be referred to a specialist for further evaluation. Readily available commercial genetic testing following the criteria listed below now enables a cost-effective (170), often cost-saving, genetic diagnosis that is increasingly supported by health insurance. A biomarker screening pathway, such as the combination of urinary C-peptide/creatinine ratio and antibody screening, may aid in determining who should get genetic testing for MODY (171). It is critical to correctly diagnose one of the monogenic forms of diabetes, because these individuals may be incorrectly diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, leading to suboptimal, even potentially harmful, treatment plans and delays in diagnosing other family members (172). The correct diagnosis is especially critical for those with GCK-MODY mutations, where multiple studies have shown that no complications ensue in the absence of glucose-lowering therapy (173). It has been reported that low hs-CRP can be used in identifying those more likely to have HNF1A-MODY as opposed to other forms of diabetes, supporting genetic testing in such individuals (174). The risks of microvascular and macrovascular complications with HNF1A-MODY and HNF4A-MODY are similar to those observed in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes (175,176). Genetic counseling is recommended to ensure that affected individuals understand the patterns of inheritance and the importance of a correct diagnosis and to address comprehensive cardiovascular risk.\\n\\n The diagnosis of monogenic diabetes should be considered in children and adults diagnosed with diabetes in early adulthood with the following findings:\\n\\n * Diabetes diagnosed within the first 6 months of life (with occasional cases presenting later, mostly INS and ABCC8 mutations) (157,177)\\n\\n * Diabetes without typical features of type 1 or type 2 diabetes (negative diabetes-associated autoantibodies, no obesity, and lacking other metabolic features, especially with strong family history of diabetes)\\n\\n * Stable, mild fasting hyperglycemia (100–150 mg/dL [5.6–8.5 mmol/L]), stable A1C between 5.6% and 7.6% (between 38 and 60 mmol/mol), especially if no obesity\\n\\n Gestational Diabetes Mellitus\\n\\n Recommendations\\n\\n * 2.25 In individuals who are planning pregnancy, screen those with risk factors (Table 2.4 ) B and consider testing all individuals of childbearing potential for undiagnosed prediabetes or diabetes.

E\\n\\n * 2.26c Screen for early abnormal glucose metabolism with dysglycemia using FPG of 110–125 mg/dL (6.1–6.9 mmol/L) or A1C 5.9–6.4% (41–47 mmol/mol).

A\\n\\n * 2.29 Individuals with a history of GDM should have lifelong screening for the development of prediabetes or diabetes at least every 3 years. B\\n\\n Definition\\n\\n For many years, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was defined as any degree of glucose intolerance that was first recognized during pregnancy (81), regardless of the degree of hyperglycemia. This definition facilitated a uniform strategy for detection and classification of GDM, but this definition has serious limitations (178). First, the best available evidence reveals that many cases of GDM represent preexisting hyperglycemia that is detected by routine screening in pregnancy, as routine screening is not widely performed in nonpregnant individuals of reproductive age. It is the severity of hyperglycemia that is clinically important regarding both short- and long-term maternal and fetal risks.\\n\\n The ongoing epidemic of obesity and diabetes has led to more type 2 diabetes in people of reproductive age, with an increase in the number of pregnant individuals with undiagnosed type 2 diabetes in early pregnancy (179–181). Ideally, undiagnosed diabetes should be identified preconception in individuals with risk factors or in high-risk populations (182–187), as the preconception care of people with preexisting diabetes results in lower A1C and reduced risk of birth defects, preterm delivery, perinatal mortality, small-for-gestational-age birth weight, and neonatal intensive care unit admission (188). If individuals are not screened prior to pregnancy, universal early screening at <15 weeks of gestation for undiagnosed diabetes may be considered over selective screening (Table 2.4 ), particularly in populations with high prevalence of risk factors and undiagnosed diabetes in people of childbearing age. Strong racial and ethnic disparities exist in the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes. Therefore, early screening provides an initial step to identify these health disparities so that they can begin to be addressed (184–187). Standard diagnostic criteria for identifying undiagnosed diabetes in early pregnancy are the same as those used in the nonpregnant population (Table 2.1 ). Individuals found to have diabetes by the standard diagnostic criteria used outside of pregnancy should be classified as having diabetes complicating pregnancy (most often type 2 diabetes, rarely type 1 diabetes or monogenic diabetes) and managed accordingly.\\n\\n Early abnormal glucose metabolism, defined as a fasting glucose threshold of 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L) or an A1C of 5.9% (41 mmol/mol), may identify individuals who are at higher risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes (preeclampsia, macrosomia, shoulder dystocia, and perinatal death), are more likely to need insulin treatment, and are at high risk of a later GDM diagnosis (189–194). An A1C threshold of 5.7% has not been shown to be associated with adverse perinatal outcomes (195,196).\\n\\n If early screening is negative, individuals should be rescreened for GDM between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation (see Section 15, “Management of Diabetes in Pregnancy”). The International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) GDM diagnostic criteria for the 75-g OGTT, as well as the GDM screening and diagnostic criteria used in the two-step approach, were not derived from data in the first half of pregnancy and should not be used for early screening (197). To date, most randomized controlled trials of treatment of early abnormal glucose metabolism have been underpowered for outcomes. A recent randomized controlled trial performed at 17 centers administered early screening (mean 15.6 ± 2.5 weeks) for GDM with a 75-g OGTT. Individuals who met World Health Organization criteria for GDM were randomized to receive early treatment or a repeat OGTT at 24–28 weeks (with deferred treatment if indicated). The first primary outcome measure was an adverse neonatal composite outcome including birth <37 weeks, birth weight ≥4.5 kg, birth trauma, neonatal respiratory distress within 24 h of birth, phototherapy, stillbirth neonatal death, or shoulder dystocia. Early GDM treatment resulted in a significant but modest improvement in the composite adverse neonatal outcome (24.9% early treatment vs. 30.5% control, relative risk 0.82 [0.68–0.98]), with a suggestion of more benefit (per prespecified subgroup analyses) among individuals who had the OGTT at <14 weeks and among individuals with glycemic values in higher ranges on their OGTTs (198). Therefore, the benefits of treatment for early abnormal glucose metabolism remain uncertain. Nutrition counseling and periodic “block” testing of glucose levels weekly to identify individuals with high glucose levels are suggested. Testing frequency may proceed to daily, and treatment may be intensified, if the FPG is predominantly >110 mg/dL (>6.1 mmol/L) prior to 18 weeks of gestation.\\n\\n Both the FPG and A1C are low-cost tests. An advantage of the A1C test is its convenience, as it can be added to the prenatal laboratories and does not require an early-morning fasting appointment. Disadvantages include inaccuracies in the presence of increased red blood cell turnover and hemoglobinopathies (usually reads lower) and higher values with anemia and reduced red blood cell turnover (199). A1C is not reliable for screening for GDM or for preexisting diabetes at 15 weeks of gestation or later; if the first screening takes place at this stage, one cannot differentiate between preexisting diabetes and GDM with an A1C.\\n\\n GDM is often indicative of underlying β-cell dysfunction (200), which confers marked increased risk for later development of diabetes, generally but not always type 2 diabetes, in the mother after delivery (201,202). As effective prevention interventions are available (203,204), individuals diagnosed with GDM should receive lifelong screening for prediabetes to allow interventions to reduce diabetes risk and for type 2 diabetes to allow treatment at the earliest possible time (205).\\n\\n Diagnosis\\n\\n GDM carries risks for the mother, fetus, and neonate. The Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study (206), a large-scale multinational cohort study completed by more than 23,000 pregnant individuals, demonstrated that risk of adverse maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes continuously increased as a function of maternal glycemia at 24–28 weeks of gestation, even within ranges previously considered normal for pregnancy. For most complications, there was no threshold for risk. These results have led to careful reconsideration of the diagnostic criteria for GDM.\\n\\n GDM diagnosis (Table 2.7 ) can be accomplished with either of two strategies:\\n\\n 1. The “one-step” 75-g OGTT derived from the IADPSG criteria, or\\n\\n 2. The older “two-step” approach with a 50-g (nonfasting) screen followed by a 100-g OGTT for those who screen positive based on the work of Carpenter-Coustan’s interpretation of the older O’Sullivan and Mahan (207) criteria.\\n\\n Table 2.7\\n\\n Screening for and diagnosis of GDM\\n\\n One-step strategy \\n Perform a 75-g OGTT, with plasma glucose measurement when an individual is fasting and at 1 and 2 h, at 24–28 weeks of gestation in individuals not previously diagnosed with diabetes. \\n The OGTT should be performed in the morning after an overnight fast of at least 8 h. \\n The diagnosis of GDM is made when any of the following plasma glucose values are met or exceeded: \\n • Fasting: 92 mg/dL (5.1 mmol/L) \\n • 1 h: 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L) \\n • 2 h: 153 mg/dL (8.5 mmol/L) \\n Two-step strategy \\n Step 1: Perform a 50-g GLT (nonfasting), with plasma glucose measurement at 1 h, at 24–28 weeks of gestation in individuals not previously diagnosed with diabetes. \\n If the plasma glucose level measured 1 h after the load is ≥130, 135, or 140 mg/dL (7.2, 7.5, or 7.8 mmol/L, respectively),* proceed to a 100-g OGTT. \\n Step 2: The 100-g OGTT should be performed when the individual is fasting. \\n The diagnosis of GDM is made when at least two† of the following four plasma glucose levels (measured fasting and at 1, 2, and 3 h during OGTT) are met or exceeded (Carpenter-Coustan criteria [226]):\\n • Fasting: 95 mg/dL (5.3 mmol/L) \\n • 1 h: 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L) \\n • 2 h: 155 mg/dL (8.6 mmol/L) \\n • 3 h: 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) \\n \\n One-step strategy \\n Perform a 75-g OGTT, with plasma glucose measurement when an individual is fasting and at 1 and 2 h, at 24–28 weeks of gestation in individuals not previously diagnosed with diabetes. \\n The OGTT should be performed in the morning after an overnight fast of at least 8 h. \\n The diagnosis of GDM is made when any of the following plasma glucose values are met or exceeded: \\n • Fasting: 92 mg/dL (5.1 mmol/L) \\n • 1 h: 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L) \\n • 2 h: 153 mg/dL (8.5 mmol/L) \\n Two-step strategy \\n Step 1: Perform a 50-g GLT (nonfasting), with plasma glucose measurement at 1 h, at 24–28 weeks of gestation in individuals not previously diagnosed with diabetes. \\n If the plasma glucose level measured 1 h after the load is ≥130, 135, or 140 mg/dL (7.2, 7.5, or 7.8 mmol/L, respectively),* proceed to a 100-g OGTT. \\n Step 2: The 100-g OGTT should be performed when the individual is fasting. \\n The diagnosis of GDM is made when at least two† of the following four plasma glucose levels (measured fasting and at 1, 2, and 3 h during OGTT) are met or exceeded (Carpenter-Coustan criteria [226]):\\n • Fasting: 95 mg/dL (5.3 mmol/L) \\n • 1 h: 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L) \\n • 2 h: 155 mg/dL (8.6 mmol/L) \\n • 3 h: 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) \\n \\n\\n GDM, gestational diabetes mellitus; GLT, glucose load test; OGTT, oral glucose tolerance test.\\n\\n *\\n\\n American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends any of the commonly used thresholds of 130, 135, or 140 mg/dL for the 1-h 50-g GLT (222).\\n\\n †\\n\\n ACOG notes that one elevated value can be used for diagnosis (222).\\n\\n View Large\\n\\n Different diagnostic criteria will identify different degrees of maternal hyperglycemia and maternal/fetal risk, leading some experts to debate, and disagree on, optimal strategies for the diagnosis of GDM.\\n\\n One-Step Strategy\\n\\n The IADPSG defined diagnostic cut points for GDM as the average fasting, 1-h, and 2-h PG values during a 75-g OGTT in individuals at 24–28 weeks of gestation who participated in the HAPO study at which odds for adverse outcomes reached 1.75 times the estimated odds of these outcomes at the mean fasting, 1-h, and 2-h PG levels of the study population. This one-step strategy was anticipated to significantly increase the incidence of GDM (from 5–6% to 15–20%), primarily because only one abnormal value, not two, became sufficient to make the diagnosis (208). Many regional studies have investigated the impact of adopting the IADPSG criteria on prevalence and have seen a roughly one- to threefold increase (209). The anticipated increase in the incidence of GDM could have a substantial impact on costs and medical infrastructure needs and has the potential to “medicalize” pregnancies previously categorized as normal. A follow-up study of individuals participating in a study of pregnancy OGTTs with glucose levels blinded to caregivers found that 11 years after their pregnancies, individuals who would have been diagnosed with GDM by the one-step approach, as compared with those without GDM, were at 3.4-fold higher risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and had children with a higher risk of obesity and increased body fat, suggesting that the larger group of individuals identified as having GDM by the one-step approach would benefit from the increased screening for diabetes and prediabetes after pregnancy (210). The ADA recommends the IADPSG diagnostic criteria with the intent of optimizing gestational outcomes, because these criteria are the only ones based on pregnancy outcomes rather than end points such as prediction of subsequent maternal diabetes.\\n\\n The expected benefits of using IADPSG criteria to the offspring are inferred from intervention trials that focused on individuals with lower levels of hyperglycemia than those identified using older GDM diagnostic criteria. Those trials found modest benefits, including reduced rates of large-for-gestational-age births and preeclampsia (211,212). It is important to note that 80–90% of participants being treated for mild GDM in these two randomized controlled trials could be managed with lifestyle therapy alone. The OGTT glucose cutoffs in these two trials overlapped the thresholds recommended by the IADPSG, and in one trial (212), the 2-h PG threshold (140 mg/dL [7.8 mmol/L]) was lower than the cutoff recommended by the IADPSG (153 mg/dL [8.5 mmol/L]).\\n\\n No randomized controlled trials of treating versus not treating GDM diagnosed by the IADPSG criteria but not the Carpenter-Coustan criteria have been published to date. However, a recent randomized trial of testing for GDM at 24–28 weeks of gestation by the one-step method using IADPSG criteria versus the two-step method using a 1-h 50-g glucose loading test (GLT) and, if positive, a 3-h OGTT by Carpenter-Coustan criteria identified twice as many individuals with GDM using the one-step method compared with the two-step method. Despite treating more individuals for GDM using the one-step method, there was no difference in pregnancy and perinatal complications (213). However, concerns have been raised about sample size estimates and unanticipated suboptimal engagement with the protocol regarding screening and treatment. For example, in the two-step group, 165 participants who did not get counted as having GDM were treated for isolated elevated FPG >95 mg/dL (>5.3 mmol/L) (214). The high prevalence of prediabetes in people of childbearing age may support the more inclusive IADPSG criteria. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data demonstrate a 21.5% prevalence of prediabetes in people of reproductive age of 20–44 years, which is comparable to or higher than the prevalence of GDM diagnosed by the one-step method (215).\\n\\n The one-step method identifies the long-term risks of maternal prediabetes and diabetes and offspring abnormal glucose metabolism and adiposity. Post hoc GDM in individuals diagnosed by the one-step method in the HAPO cohort was associated with higher prevalence of IGT; higher 30-min, 1-h, and 2-h glucoses during the OGTT; and reduced insulin sensitivity and oral disposition index in their offspring at 10–14 years of age compared with offspring of mothers without GDM. Associations of mother’s fasting, 1-h, and 2-h values on the 75-g OGTT were continuous with a comprehensive panel of offspring metabolic outcomes (216,217). In addition, HAPO Follow-up Study (HAPO FUS) data demonstrate that neonatal adiposity and fetal hyperinsulinemia (cord C-peptide), both higher across the continuum of maternal hyperglycemia, are mediators of childhood body fat (218).\\n\\n Data are lacking on how the treatment of mother’s hyperglycemia in pregnancy affects her offspring’s risk for obesity, diabetes, and other metabolic disorders (219,220). Additional well-designed clinical studies are needed to determine the optimal intensity of monitoring and treatment of individuals with GDM diagnosed by the one-step strategy.\\n\\n Two-Step Strategy\\n\\n In 2013, the NIH convened a consensus development conference to consider diagnostic criteria for diagnosing GDM (221). The 15-member panel had representatives from obstetrics and gynecology, maternal-fetal medicine, pediatrics, diabetes research, biostatistics, and other related fields. The panel recommended a two-step approach to screening that used a 1-h 50-g GLT followed by a 3-h 100-g OGTT for those who screened positive. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends any of the commonly used thresholds of 130, 135, or 140 mg/dL for the 1-h 50-g GLT (222). Updated from 2014, a 2021 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force systematic review continued to conclude that one-step versus two-step screening is associated with increased likelihood of GDM (11.5% vs. 4.9%) but without improved health outcomes. It reported that the oral glucose challenge test using thresholds of 140 or 135 mg/dL had sensitivities of 82% and 93% and specificities of 82% and 79%, respectively, against Carpenter-Coustan criteria. FPG cutoffs of 85 mg/dL and 90 mg/dL had sensitivities of 88% and 81% and specificities of 73% and 82%, respectively, against Carpenter-Coustan criteria (223). The use of A1C at 24–28 weeks of gestation as a screening test for GDM does not function as well as the GLT (224).\\n\\n Key factors cited by the NIH panel in their decision-making process were the lack of clinical trial data demonstrating the benefits of the one-step strategy and the potential negative consequences of identifying a large group of individuals with GDM, including medicalization of pregnancy with increased health care utilization and costs. Moreover, screening with a 50-g GLT does not require fasting and therefore is easier to accomplish for many individuals. Treatment of higher-threshold maternal hyperglycemia, as identified by the two-step approach, reduces rates of neonatal macrosomia, large-for-gestational-age births (225), and shoulder dystocia without increasing small-for-gestational-age births. ACOG currently supports the two-step approach but notes that one elevated value, as opposed to two, may be used for the diagnosis of GDM (222). If this approach is implemented, the incidence of GDM by the two-step strategy will likely increase markedly. ACOG recommends either of two sets of diagnostic thresholds for the 3-h 100-g OGTT Carpenter-Coustan or National Diabetes Data Group (226,227). Each is based on different mathematical conversions of the original recommended thresholds by O’Sullivan and Mahan (207), which used whole blood and nonenzymatic methods for glucose determination. A secondary analysis of data from a randomized clinical trial of identification and treatment of mild GDM (228) demonstrated that treatment was similarly beneficial in people meeting only the lower thresholds per Carpenter-Coustan (226) and in those meeting only the higher thresholds per National Diabetes Data Group (227). If the two-step approach is used, it would appear advantageous to use the Carpenter-Coustan lower diagnostic thresholds, as shown in step 2 in Table 2.7 .\\n\\n Future Considerations\\n\\n The conflicting recommendations from expert groups underscore the fact that there are data to support each strategy. A systematic review of economic evaluations of GDM screening found that the one-step method identified more cases of GDM and was more likely to be cost-effective than the two-step method (229). The decision of which strategy to implement must therefore be made based on the relative values placed on factors that have yet to be measured (e.g., willingness to change practice based on correlation studies rather than intervention trial results, available infrastructure, and importance of cost considerations).\\n\\n The IADPSG criteria (one-step strategy) have been adopted internationally as the preferred approach. Data that compare population-wide outcomes with one-step versus two-step approaches have been inconsistent to date (213,230–232). In addition, pregnancies complicated by GDM per the IADPSG criteria, but not recognized as such, have outcomes comparable to pregnancies with diagnosed GDM by the more stringent two-step criteria (233,234). There remains strong consensus that establishing a uniform approach to diagnosing GDM will benefit people with GDM, caregivers, and policymakers. Longer-term outcome studies are currently underway.\\n\\n *\\n\\n A complete list of members of the American Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee can be found at https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-SINT.\\n\\n Duality of interest information for each author is available at https://doi.org/10.2337/dc24-SDIS.\\n\\n Suggested citation: American Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee. 2.

Diabetes can be diagnosed by demonstrating increased concentrations of glucose in venous plasma or increased A1C in the blood. Diabetes is classified conventionally into several clinical categories (e.g., type 1 or type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes mellitus, and other specific types derived from other causes, such as genetic causes, exocrine pancreatic disorders, and medications). Diagnosis is based on A1C or plasma glucose criteria, either the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) value, 2-h plasma glucose (2-h PG) value during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or random glucose value accompanied by classic hyperglycemic symptoms/crises criteria.\\\"}\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"searchTime\": 3220.6,\n  \"costDollars\": {\n    \"total\": 0.009,\n    \"search\": {\n      \"neural\": 0.005\n    },\n    \"contents\": {\n      \"text\": 0.002,\n      \"summary\": 0.002\n    }\n  }\n}\n**Executive Summary**  \nThe 2022–2024 ADA Standards of Care in Diabetes provide comprehensive, evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis, classification, and pharmacologic treatment of diabetes, with detailed distinctions between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Both conditions have unique pathophysiologies, diagnostic criteria, and treatment protocols, but share common risks for chronic complications. Recent systematic reviews and consensus recommendations emphasize individualized, risk-based approaches for diagnosis and therapy, with a growing focus on precision medicine.\n\n---\n\n**Introduction: Context and Scope**  \nThis synthesis integrates the most recent (2022–2024) American Diabetes Association (ADA) clinical guidelines and systematic reviews regarding the diagnosis, classification, and pharmacologic management of diabetes, with a particular focus on comparing treatment efficacy and outcomes in type 1 versus type 2 diabetes.\n\n---\n\n**Main Findings by Theme**\n\n**1. Diagnosis and Classification**\n\n- **Diagnostic Criteria**:  \n  Diabetes diagnosis is based on A1C (≥6.5%), fasting plasma glucose (FPG ≥126 mg/dL), 2-hour plasma glucose during OGTT (≥200 mg/dL), or random plasma glucose (≥200 mg/dL) with hyperglycemic symptoms. Confirmatory testing is required in the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia. (ADA, 2024)[1]\n\n- **Classification**:  \n  Diabetes is categorized as type 1 (autoimmune β-cell destruction), type 2 (progressive insulin secretory defect, usually with insulin resistance), gestational diabetes, and specific types due to other causes (e.g., monogenic, pancreatic, or drug-induced diabetes). (ADA, 2024)[1]\n\n- **Differentiation**:  \n  Type 1 diabetes typically presents at a younger age, with lower BMI, rapid onset, and islet autoantibodies, while type 2 diabetes is more common in adults, often with obesity and insulin resistance. However, there is considerable overlap, and misclassification is common, especially in adults. (ADA, 2024)[1]\n\n**2. Pathophysiology and Disease Course**\n\n- **Type 1 Diabetes**:  \n  Characterized by autoimmune destruction of β-cells, leading to absolute insulin deficiency. Rapid progression is more common in children, while adults may have slower onset (including latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, LADA). (ADA, 2024)[1]\n\n- **Type 2 Diabetes**:  \n  Involves a combination of insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency, with a strong genetic component and links to obesity and metabolic syndrome. The disease often develops gradually and may remain undiagnosed for years. (ADA, 2024)[1]\n\n**3. Pharmacologic Treatment Approaches**\n\n- **Type 1 Diabetes**:  \n  - Insulin therapy is essential; recommended regimens include multiple daily injections (MDI) of basal and prandial insulin or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII, via pump).\n  - Insulin analogs are preferred over human insulins to reduce hypoglycemia risk.\n  - Early adoption of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and automated insulin delivery (AID) systems is advised to improve glycemic outcomes and quality of life.\n  - Adjunctive non-insulin therapies (e.g., pramlintide, GLP-1 RAs, SGLT2 inhibitors) show modest benefits but carry risks such as increased diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with SGLT2 inhibitors.\n  - Surgical options (pancreas/islet transplantation) are reserved for select patients with severe glycemic instability. (ADA, 2024)[2]\n\n- **Type 2 Diabetes**:  \n  - First-line therapy is typically metformin, with early consideration of combination therapy if A1C is ≥1.5% above target.\n  - Additional agents are selected based on comorbidities (e.g., cardiovascular, renal), efficacy, hypoglycemia risk, impact on weight, cost, and patient preference.\n  - SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists are prioritized for patients with cardiovascular or renal disease due to proven benefits in outcome trials.\n  - Insulin is reserved for patients with severe hyperglycemia or catabolic features, and should be initiated without delay if indicated.\n  - Combination injectable therapy (insulin plus GLP-1 RA) is superior to insulin alone for glycemic control and weight management. (ADA, 2024)[2]\n\n**4. Outcomes and Comparative Efficacy**\n\n- **Type 1 Diabetes**:  \n  - Intensive glycemic control (A1C ≈7%) reduces microvascular complications by ~50% over 6 years (DCCT/EDIC).\n  - Modern insulin analogs, CGMs, and AID systems further improve glycemic variability and reduce hypoglycemia, but are associated with higher costs and complexity.\n  - Adjunctive therapies provide incremental benefits but are not universally recommended due to safety concerns.\n\n- **Type 2 Diabetes**:  \n  - Glycemic control reduces risk of microvascular and, to a lesser extent, macrovascular complications.\n  - Cardiovascular and renal outcome trials have established SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs as agents of choice for patients with comorbidities, independent of baseline glycemic control.\n  - Remission of type 2 diabetes is achievable in some patients with intensive lifestyle intervention or bariatric/metabolic surgery.\n\n- **Comparison**:  \n  - Both types benefit from intensive glycemic management, but the absolute risk reductions and therapeutic approaches differ due to underlying pathophysiology.\n  - Type 1 diabetes requires lifelong insulin; type 2 diabetes management is more heterogeneous and can, in some cases, achieve remission.\n  - Hypoglycemia risk is higher in type 1 diabetes and with insulin/sulfonylurea use in type 2 diabetes.\n\n**5. Systematic Reviews and Evidence Quality**\n\n- The ADA guidelines are based on systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and consensus statements, with annual updates reflecting the latest high-quality evidence.\n- Systematic reviews support the superiority of insulin analogs and technology-enabled management in type 1 diabetes, and the cardiovascular/renal benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs in type 2 diabetes.\n- Evidence gaps remain in head-to-head comparisons of treatment strategies in real-world, diverse populations.\n\n---\n\n**Critical Analysis of Evidence Quality**\n\n- The ADA Standards are widely regarded as authoritative, drawing on RCTs, meta-analyses, and expert consensus.\n- Evidence for technology-enabled care (CGM, AID) in type 1 diabetes is robust for glycemic endpoints, but long-term data on complications and cost-effectiveness are still evolving.\n- Cardiovascular outcome trials in type 2 diabetes provide high-level evidence for specific drug classes, but generalizability to all patient populations (e.g., older adults, ethnic minorities) may be limited.\n- Areas of uncertainty include optimal sequencing of therapies, management of atypical and monogenic diabetes, and long-term outcomes of diabetes remission.\n\n---\n\n**Synthesis of Key Insights and Patterns**\n\n- Diabetes is a heterogeneous group of disorders requiring individualized diagnosis and management.\n- Early, accurate classification is essential for optimal therapy and prevention of complications.\n- Type 1 diabetes management is increasingly technology-driven, while type 2 diabetes management is becoming more personalized based on comorbidity profiles.\n- Both types share common endpoints (microvascular/macrovascular complications), but differ in treatment intensity, risk of hypoglycemia, and potential for remission.\n- Socioeconomic factors, access to care, and medication/device costs remain barriers to optimal outcomes.\n\n---\n\n**Limitations and Gaps Identified**\n\n- Limited direct comparative outcome data between type 1 and type 2 diabetes treatments in matched populations.\n- Insufficient evidence on long-term outcomes of new technologies and adjunctive therapies in type 1 diabetes.\n- Need for more real-world evidence and comparative effectiveness studies in diverse populations.\n- Cost-effectiveness and access to advanced therapies and devices are ongoing challenges.\n\n---\n\n**Evidence-Based Conclusions**\n\n- ADA guidelines provide a rigorous, up-to-date framework for the diagnosis and management of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\n- While type 1 diabetes mandates lifelong insulin therapy, advances in insulin analogs and technology have improved outcomes.\n- Type 2 diabetes treatment is increasingly tailored to individual risk profiles, with strong evidence for the use of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs in patients with cardiovascular or renal disease.\n- Both types require ongoing risk factor management and individualized care to reduce complications and improve quality of life.\n\n---\n\n**Future Research Directions**\n\n- Head-to-head trials comparing novel technologies and pharmacologic agents across diabetes types and subgroups.\n- Long-term studies on the impact of early diagnosis, technology adoption, and precision medicine approaches.\n- Implementation science to address disparities in access to advanced therapies and optimize real-world outcomes.\n- Further elucidation of pathophysiologic mechanisms to refine diabetes classification and treatment.\n\n---\n\n**References**  \n1.

However, the full-text context and referenced systematic reviews do provide sufficient comparative information when synthesized. No critical errors were found in the tool output, but synthesis was necessary to extract comparative insights.\n<thinking>\nI need to analyze this request carefully. The user has asked me to synthesize information about the latest FDA-approved medications for diabetes treatment in 2023-2024, with a specific focus on GLP-1 agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, and artificial pancreas systems.\n\nLet me review the search results provided:\n\n1. The first search was about \"Latest FDA-approved medications and technological advancements for diabetes treatment 2023-2024, including GLP-1 agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, and artificial pancreas systems\" but the results didn't provide current 2023-2024 approvals.\n\n2. The second search was about \"Evidence-based clinical guidelines and systematic reviews of diabetes treatment efficacy from ADA, EASD, and Cochrane 2022-2024, comparing outcomes for Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes\" which returned comprehensive guidelines but not specifically focused on the latest FDA approvals.\n\nThe search results contain:\n- A Healthline article about diabetes medications (but last updated in 2022)\n- ADA website content on oral and injectable medications for Type 2 diabetes\n- ADA Standards of Care in Diabetes 2024 (including pharmacologic approaches and diagnosis/classification)\n\nHowever, I notice that none of these sources specifically list the FDA approvals for 2023-2024. The information is more general about diabetes treatment approaches and medication classes rather than focusing on the most recent approvals.\n\nGiven this, I should:\n1. Clearly acknowledge that the search results don't provide a comprehensive list of 2023-2024 FDA approvals\n2. Extract whatever relevant information is available about newer medications mentioned\n3. Provide a structured response that's helpful despite this limitation\n4. Suggest where the user might find more up-to-date information\n</thinking>\n\n# Latest FDA-Approved Diabetes Medications and Technologies (2023-2024)\n\n## Summary of Findings\n\nBased on the search results provided, I cannot offer a comprehensive list of all FDA-approved diabetes medications for 2023-2024. The sources retrieved contain general information about diabetes treatment approaches and medication classes but lack specific details about the most recent FDA approvals during this timeframe.\n\n## What Was Found in the Search Results\n\n### GLP-1 Receptor Agonists\n- The search results mention established GLP-1 receptor agonists including:\n  - Injectable options: dulaglutide (Trulicity), exenatide (Byetta, Bydureon), liraglutide (Victoza), lixisenatide (Adlyxin), semaglutide (Ozempic)\n  - Oral option: semaglutide (Rybelsus)\n  - Dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist: tirzepatide (Mounjaro)\n\n### SGLT2 Inhibitors\n- The sources mention established SGLT2 inhibitors including:\n  - Bexagliflozin (Brenzavvy)\n  - Canagliflozin (Invokana)\n  - Dapagliflozin (Farxiga)\n  - Empagliflozin (Jardiance)\n  - Ertugliflozin\n\n### Artificial Pancreas/Automated Insulin Delivery Systems\n- The ADA Standards of Care (2024) mentions:\n  - Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems are recommended for people with type 1 diabetes\n  - These systems have demonstrated improved glycemic control and reduced hypoglycemia risk\n  - The document references several studies from 2022-2023 supporting AID efficacy\n\n### Notable Information from 2023\n- The ADA Standards of Care mentions that donislecel-jujn, an allogeneic islet cell therapy, was approved in 2023 for adults with type 1 diabetes who experience severe hypoglycemia despite intensive management\n\n## Key Limitations of the Search Results\n\n1. The search did not return specific FDA approval dates for medications in 2023-2024\n2. No comprehensive list of new approvals during this timeframe was provided\n3. Information about dosing, indications, and comparative efficacy of the newest medications is limited\n\n## Where to Find More Current Information\n\nFor the most up-to-date information on FDA-approved diabetes medications from 2023-2024, I recommend:\n\n1. The FDA's official \"New Drug Approvals\" website: [www.fda.gov/drugs/new-drugs-fda-cders-new-molecular-entities-and-new-therapeutic-biological-products](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/new-drugs-fda-cders-new-molecular-entities-and-new-therapeutic-biological-products)\n\n2. The American Diabetes Association's website for the most recent updates: [diabetes.org](https://diabetes.org)\n\n3. Consulting with a healthcare provider who specializes in diabetes management for personalized information about the latest treatment options\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific information about any particular medication class or technology mentioned in the results?"
